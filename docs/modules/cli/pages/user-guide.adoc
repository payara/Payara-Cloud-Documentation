== Introduction

`pcl` is command line utility for managing Payara Cloud namespaces and applications.
It is distributed as executable jar file.
It requires Java Runtime, version 8 or newer.

=== Documentation Structure

User Guide demonstrates the concept and usage of `pcl` mainly through examples.
_Command Reference_ then lists all options and sub-commands supported by the client.
The content of reference is equivalent to output provided by option `--help`.

=== Notation used

Examples in this guide use the following convention:

[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
*command input in bold, using $var for user-specific input*
_stderr output in italics_
stdout output
----

== Getting started

=== Command Line Client prerequisities

Command Line Client is distributed as a zip package containing the client, shell wrappers for Windows and Unix-like systems and documentation package just like this one.

The client itself is an executable `.jar` file, that requires at least Java 8 to be available on the system.

=== Downloading the Command Line Client

Client is distributed over Payara's Nexus Repository under following coordinates:

[listing,subs=+attributes]
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>fish.payara.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>pcl</artifactId>
  <version>{release-version}</version>

== Logging in

`pcl` uses OAuth Device Authentication flow to establish its identity to Payara Cloud.
It will generate a confirmation code, which you use to log in to Payara Cloud web interface via browser.

[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
*pcl login*
_[INFO] In order to log in follow following link: https://login.payara.cloud/activate_
_[INFO] Your confirmation code is KKMD-STTF_
----

The client will also open the browser for you if your environment permits it.
In case you follow link manually you'll need to enter the confirmation code on first page:

[.text-center]
image:login-01-enter-code.png[width=320]

After that a confirmation page is displayed:

[.text-center]
image:login-02-confirmation.png[width=320]

WARNING: Only confirm this page if you knowingly initiated login flow via `pcl login`.
Payara Cloud will never ask you to authenticate via this flow via any other channel or under any other circumstance, such as solving a support issue.

If you are logging in for the first time the authentication service will ask you to authorize Payara Cloud CLI to perform application management tasks with your identity:

[.text-center]
image:login-03-authorize.png[width=320]

After confirming this, the authentication process is completed and you may close the browser window:

[.text-center]
image:login-04-success.png[width=320]

=== Managing tokens

After login is complete the relevant token is stored in `$HOME/.payara/manage.payara.cloud`.
The token does not have any expiration time, so you will not need to log in again for when using `pcl`.
Tokens can be invalidated remotely via User Preferences screen in Payara Cloud Web UI.

=== Non-interactive usage

Login only works for interactive sessions.
In order to be able to perform `pcl` commands in non-interactive environments such as CI `pcl login` offers option `--print-token`.

[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
*pcl login --print-token*
_[INFO] In order to log in follow following link: https://login.payara.cloud/activate_
_[INFO] Your confirmation code is CVJF-XKGH_
_[SUCCESS] Token for environment-based login:_
PCL_AUTH_TOKEN=eyJyZWZyZXNoX3Rva2VuIjoiWktMTFVQaUVIeEZ3c2JfOGNXSzFILUdnaUR1OVlXZUdDR3h3TUVFUlVrM3VLIn0=
----

The output of the command is the environment to use in order to establish the identity in a script.

In Github Actions the token can be used in following way:

Set secret `PCL_AUTH_TOKEN` for the repository to `eyJyZWZyZXNoX3Rva2VuIjoiWktMTFVQaUVIeEZ3c2JfOGNXSzFILUdnaUR1OVlXZUdDR3h3TUVFUlVrM3VLIn0=`.

In the workflow file refer to the secret like this:

[listing,language=yaml]
----
    - name: Deploy new version
      env:
        PCL_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PCL_AUTH_TOKEN }}
      run: pcl -n project-head -a main-app upload target/app.war --deploy
----

NOTE: For using pcl with Github Actions we recommend looking at our Github Action https://github.com/payara/cloud-deploy[payara/cloud-deploy].

== Common options

=== Environment Variables
The CLI supports the following environment variables to be set, reducing repetitive typing of common options:

`PCL_NAMESPACE`: Default namespace name. Used when `-n` or `--namespace` is not specified.
Required for most commands except `login`, `list-namespaces`, and `create-namespace`.

`PCL_SUBSCRIPTION`: Default subscription name. Used when `-s` or `--subscription` is not specified.
Only needed when your account has access to multiple subscriptions.

Command line options, when provided, will override these environment variables for that specific command.

=== Obtaining help

Option `--help` will provide with same content as _Command Reference_ does, listing all available options and a short description of the command.

include::examples/_Common-topLevelHelp-01.adoc[]

To find out about specific commands put `--help` after the command:

include::examples/_Common-commandHelp-01.adoc[]

=== Determining version

This prints helpful information to determine the version and environment the command runs in.

include::examples/_Common-version-01.adoc[]

=== Output options

Option `-o json` can be used to force output to be JSON only, including error messages.
Even though many commands return json in current version, it is possible that default console output will change in future versions.
Output of `-o json` is planned to remain stable.
Compare json output to those console outputs shown in <<Listing Namespaces>> and <<Creating a Namespace>> below:

include::examples/_Namespaces-canBeListedAsJson-01.adoc[]

include::examples/_Namespaces-cannotBeCreatedTwiceJson-01.adoc[]

Option `-q` will suppress all progress and warning messages, putting just the output onto `stdout` or error messages to `stderr`.

== Namespace Management

Basic namespace operations are available via CLI.
Other use cases, such as set up of custom domains or monitoring are only available via GUI.

=== Listing Namespaces

Use xref:{man-prefix}pcl-list-namespaces{man-suffix}[ list-namespaces] to see namespaces available to you:

include::examples/_Namespaces-canBeListed-01.adoc[]

For all other commands that operate on namespace, you must supply the value of name (e. g. `start-dev`) as option `-n`.

=== Creating a Namespace

Creating namespace with xref:{man-prefix}pcl-create-namespace{man-suffix}[create-namespace] takes exact same input as GUI -- project and stage the namespace should represent:

include::examples/_Namespaces-canBeCreated-01.adoc[]

Additionally, one can specify the provider and region namespace will be provisioned via option `--region`:

|===
| Region value | Provider | Region

| `azure-westeurope` | Azure | West Europe (default)
| `azure-eastus` | Azure | East US
|===

include::examples/_Namespaces-namespaceCanBeCreatedInOtherRegion-01.adoc[]

Payara Cloud can extend to support more regions and providers.
The value is therefore checked after submission.
If an invalid value is provided valid values for region will be provided in a warning message:

include::examples/_Namespaces-invalidRegionListsValidValues-01.adoc[]

Project and stage need to be unique within your subscription.
An error is reported when you attempt to create a namespace with same project/stage combination:

include::examples/_Namespaces-cannotBeCreatedTwice-01.adoc[]

=== Deleting a Namespace

Namespace can be deleted by using xref:{man-prefix}pcl-delete-namespace{man-suffix}[delete-namespace] command:

include::examples/_Namespaces-canBeDeleted-01.adoc[]

Deleting the namespace permanently removes all applications and their configurations.
Option `-y` is required to confirm this step, otherwise a warning is displayed:

include::examples/_Namespaces-requiresConfirmationFlagForDeletion-01.adoc[]

== Application Management

CLI supports all usecases related to uploading a war file, configuring it and starting the revision.

=== Uploading .war File

A new application can be created within a namespace by uploading its binary artifact using the xref:{man-prefix}pcl-upload{man-suffix}[upload] command:

include::examples/_ApplicationUpload-uploadNamesApplicationFromManifest-01.adoc[]

Uploading an artifact starts an _inspection process_, which performs scanning of the .war file whilst identifying microprofile config properties, persistence units and datasources the application might require.

The application name is determined from Maven metadata in `META-INF/maven` by default.
Should you want to override that, provide option `-a`/`--application`:

include::examples/_ApplicationUpload-specifyingNameOverridesApplication-01.adoc[]

Status `PENDING` signifies that application has not been deployed yet.
Deployment can be either performed by the  xref:{man-prefix}pcl-deploy{man-suffix}[deploy] command, or by providing option `--deploy` to the `upload` command.

include::examples/_Deployment-deploymentStraightFromUploadStartsApp-01.adoc[]

Here we see that inspection process is immediately followed by deployment process that starts up the application in target provisioning cluster.

Uploading a new `.war` for an existing application doesn't immediately deploy it.
The information that the newest state of the application is different from deployed state is represented by attribute `pendingChanges`, which is `true` in such case.

include::examples/_Deployment-uploadingNewRevisionSignalsPendingChanges-01.adoc[]

=== Deploying Application

To deploy an application as a separate step (for example after configuring it) use the xref:{man-prefix}pcl-deploy{man-suffix}[ deploy] command:

include::examples/_Deployment-deployingAfterPendingChangesMovesToRunningState-01.adoc[]

Payara Cloud will keep retrying deployment for up to 10 minutes before it pronounces deployment failed.
There are two switches to enable CLI terminate before the 10 minutes, in the scenario of deployment failure.

Note that in either of these cases backend deployment is not cancelled.
This is intentionally designed that way, because application deployment could be fail due to some external service not being available at startup.

First option is to set client-side timeout for deployment with `--timeout`.
Exit code in such case is 3.

include::examples/_Deployment-shorterTimeoutIsAppliedOnClientSide-02.adoc[]

Another option is to fail immediately after deployment problem is identified by using the option `--fail-early`.
Exit code in such case is 2.

include::examples/_Deployment-failEarlyFailsOnDeploymentProblem-03.adoc[]

These both options are also available to other commands that might trigger deployment -- xref:{man-prefix}pcl-upload{man-suffix}[upload] and xref:{man-prefix}pcl-configure{man-suffix}[configure].

==== Deployment Logs

It is also possible to see logs of the application during deployment by means of switch `--logs`.
These are raw logs from the container and are in Payara's JSON log format.
Prefix `[UPDATE]` also signifies the instance from which the log originated so that deployment of multiple instances can be distinguished.
The logs shipping will stop as soon as the deployment is finished though.

include::examples/_Deployment-logsCanBeDisplayedDuringDeployment-02.adoc[]

The switch is also available for other commands that might trigger deployment,
such as `scale`, `upload --deploy` or `configure --deploy`.

=== Listing Applications

In order to list applications within a namespace use command xref:{man-prefix}pcl-list-applications{man-suffix}[list-applications], that shows application names and their basic properties:

include::examples/_Deployment-listApplicationsShowsState-04.adoc[]

=== Stopping an Application

A running application can be stopped with xref:{man-prefix}pcl-stop{man-suffix}[stop], providing the application name.

include::examples/_Deployment-runningApplicationCanBeStopped-01.adoc[]

A warning is displayed when application is in a state that doesn't permit stopping it:

include::examples/_Deployment-stoppedApplicationCannotBeStopped-01.adoc[]

=== Starting an Application

A stopped application can be started again by using the xref:{man-prefix}pcl-start{man-suffix}[start] command.

include::examples/_Deployment-stoppedApplicationCanBeStarted-01.adoc[]

If the application is not stopped, the command fails.

include::examples/_Deployment-runningApplicationCannotBeStarted-01.adoc[]

=== Configuring an Application

The most dynamic command of cli is xref:{man-prefix}pcl-configure{man-suffix}[configure].
Available sub-commands of `configure` depend on specific application and the configuration options it provides.

The configuration of an application consists of several partial configurations, that describe particular facets of that application.
Semantics of partial configuration is represented by configuration kind, such as data source or context root configuration).
Usually application has at most one partial configuration for each configuration kind, with only exception being data source, which has one configuration of kind `dataSource` for every data source identified.

Available configuration kinds can be seen by invoking detailed help of `configure` command while also specifying the target application:

include::examples/_Configuration-helpListsConfigurationKinds-02.adoc[]

include::examples/_Configuration-detailedHelpListsFurtherOptions-01.adoc[]

Recognized configuration parameters are keys that are known to exist for that particular configuration kind, and are reconfigured using syntax `<parameter>=<value>` after specifyig the configuration kind.

When reconfiguration succeeds full configuration of the application as well as metadata about the keys is returned as result

include::examples/_Configuration-applicationCanBeReconfigured-01.adoc[]

Changes are not immediately deployed.
Command xref:{man-prefix}pcl-deploy{man-suffix}[deploy] needs to be invoked to make them live.
Alternatively option `--deploy` can be passed to `configure` to trigger deployment immediately after reconfiguring.
In such case output of the `configure` command matches output of `deploy` command.

include::examples/_Configuration-changesCanBeImmediatelyDeployed-02.adoc[]

If provided parameter does not meet the syntax requirements or the entire configuration is not consistent the commands ends with a failure.

include::examples/_Configuration-incorrectInputGivesReasonableErrorMesage-01.adoc[]

Client will prevent to define configuration keys, that are not known.

include::examples/_Configuration-unknownPropertyGivesErrorMessage-01.adoc[]

But it is valid use case to add a new property for `microprofileConfig`, in which case option `--add` needs to be used.

include::examples/_Configuration-propertyCanBeAdded-01.adoc[]

Multiple configurations and their attributes can be set at same time:

include::examples/_Configuration-multipleConfigurationsAndPropertiesCanBeSet-01.adoc[]

A configuration key can be reset to its default value, or removed if it doesn't have default value and is not required.
This can be achieved with option `--reset <key>`.

include::examples/_Configuration-propertyCanBeResetToDefaultValue-01.adoc[]

To enable horizontal scaling, add a new property for `appRuntime` to your configuration. Set the value of the `scalabilityType` parameter to `HORIZONTAL_SCALING` and specify the desired number of replicas.

include::examples/_Deployment-scaleApplicationWithHorizontalScaling-01.adoc[]

Logs can be seen in console with deployment progress.

include::examples/_Deployment-scaleApplicationWithHorizontalScaling-03.adoc[]

If the application is configured for horizontal scaling, you can scale it directly by specifying the desired number of instances.

include::examples/_Deployment-scaleApplication-01.adoc[]
