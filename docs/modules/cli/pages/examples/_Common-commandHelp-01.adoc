*pcl upload --help*
Usage: pcl upload [-ehlqV] [--deploy] [-a=<applicationName>]
                  [-n=<namespaceName>] [-o=<outputFormat>]
                  [-s=<subscriptionName>] [-t=<seconds>] <file>
Upload an application binary (.war file) to Payara Cloud.
This command can either provide a new binary for an existing application or
upload a new application into a namespace.
      <file>                Application archive file (.war) to be uploaded
  -a, --application=<applicationName>
                            Name of application to manage.
                            Not required for commands listed by +++`+++-n+++`+++ option, as
                              well as +++`+++list-applications+++`+++ and +++`+++upload+++`+++.
      --deploy              Deploy the application immediately after uploading.
                            The application will only deploy if its default
                              configuration is complete  (i.e., all required
                              options have default values).
  -e, --fail-early          Fail command immediately after first deployment
                              problem instead of waiting for timeout on client
                              or backend side
                            There are certain scenarios when deployment can
                              succeed despite reported deployment problems.
                            This means that even if you receive early warning
                              messages about deployment failures, the
                              application might still start up and run properly
                              later.
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -l, --logs                Shows application deployment logs in real-time
  -n, --namespace=<namespaceName>
                            Name of namespace to manage.
                            Required for all commands except +++`+++login+++`+++,
                              +++`+++list-namespaces+++`+++ and +++`+++create-namespace+++`+++.
  -o, --output=<outputFormat>
                            Set the output format. Allowed values: TEXT, JSON.
  -q, --quiet               Enable quiet output.
                            Only result of operations will be displayed to
                              +++`+++stdout+++`+++, or error message to +++`+++stderrr+++`+++.
  -s, --subscription=<subscriptionName>
                            Specify the name of the subscription to use. This
                              is only necessary when your account has access to
                              multiple subscriptions.
  -t, --timeout=<seconds>   Sets how long to wait for deployment completion on
                              the client side.
                            This timeout doesn't affect the actual deployment
                              process in Payara Cloud, so applications might
                              still start up even after a timeout occurs.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
