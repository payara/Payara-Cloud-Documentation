*pcl upload --help*
Usage: pcl upload [-ehqV] [--deploy] [-a=<applicationName>]
                  [-n=<namespaceName>] [-o=<outputFormat>]
                  [-s=<subscriptionName>] [-t=<timeout>] <file>
Upload application binary
Use to either provide new binary for existing application by specifying option
+++`+++-a+++`+++ / +++`+++--application+++`+++, or to upload new application into a namespace.
      <file>                Application archive file (.war) to be uploaded
  -a, --application=<applicationName>
                            Name of application to manage.
                            Not required for commands listed by +++`+++-n+++`+++ option, as
                              well as +++`+++list-applications+++`+++ and +++`+++upload+++`+++.
      --deploy              Deploy application immediately.
                            Application will be immediately deployed after
                              upload if its default configuration is complete,
                              i. e. all required option have default values.
  -e, --fail-early          Fail command immediately after first deployment
                              problem instead of waiting for timeout on client
                              or backend side
                            There are certain scenarios when deployment can
                              succeed despite deployment problems reported.
                            It is therefore not guaranteed that application
                              deployment that failed with early warning will
                              not start up later.
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -n, --namespace=<namespaceName>
                            Name of namespace to manage.
                            Required for all commands except +++`+++login+++`+++,
                              +++`+++list-namespaces+++`+++ and +++`+++create-namespace+++`+++.
  -o, --output=<outputFormat>
                            Output format. Allowed values: TEXT, JSON.
  -q, --quiet               Quiet output.
                            Only result of operations will be displayed to
                              +++`+++stdout+++`+++, or error message to +++`+++stderrr+++`+++.
  -s, --subscription=<subscriptionName>
                            Name of subscription to use. Only necessary when
                              account has access to multiple subscriptions.
  -t, --timeout=<timeout>   Duration in seconds specifying how long to wait for
                              deployment to complete
                            This is client side timeout which doesn't affect
                              deployment process in Payara Cloud. It is
                              therefore not guaranteed that application
                              deployment that failed due to this time out will
                              not eventually start up later.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
