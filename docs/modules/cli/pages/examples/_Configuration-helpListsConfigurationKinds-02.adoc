Usage: configure [-ehlV] [--deploy] [-t=<timeout>] [<CONFIGURATION KIND>
                 key=value...]...
      --deploy              Deploy revision with updated configuration
                              immediately
  -e, --fail-early          Fail command immediately after first deployment
                              problem instead of waiting for timeout on client
                              or backend side
                            There are certain scenarios when deployment can
                              succeed despite deployment problems reported.
                            It is therefore not guaranteed that application
                              deployment that failed with early warning will
                              not start up later.
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -l, --logs                Show application's logs during deployment
  -t, --timeout=<timeout>   Duration in seconds specifying how long to wait for
                              deployment to complete
                            This is client side timeout which doesn't affect
                              deployment process in Payara Qube (Managed). It is
                              therefore not guaranteed that application
                              deployment that failed due to this time out will
                              not eventually start up later.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
