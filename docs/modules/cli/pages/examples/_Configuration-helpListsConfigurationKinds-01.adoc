*pcl -n _$namespace_ -a _$appName_ configure --help*
Usage: configure [-ehlV] [--deploy] [-t=<timeout>] [<CONFIGURATION KIND>
                 key=value...]...
      --deploy              Applies and deploys configuration changes immediately

  -e, --fail-early          Stops the command at the first deployment issue, rather than waiting for timeout.
                                Note that applications may still deploy successfully even if problems are initially reported.
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -l, --logs                Shows application deployment logs in real-time
  -t, --timeout=<seconds>   DSets how long to wait for deployment completion on the client side.
                                This timeout doesn't affect the actual deployment process in Payara Cloud, so applications might still start up even after a timeout occurs.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
Configuration kinds:
  microprofileConfig
  appRuntime
  contextRoot
