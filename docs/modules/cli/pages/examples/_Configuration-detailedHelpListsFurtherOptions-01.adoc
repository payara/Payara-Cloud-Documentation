Usage: configure contextRoot [-ehlV] [--deploy] [-t=<seconds>]
                             [--add=<key>=<value>]...
                             [--reset=<removedParameters>]... [<key>=<value>...]
      [<key>=<value>...]    Property to set in a configuration
      --add=<key>=<value>   Properties to add to configuration
      --deploy              Deploy revision with updated configuration
                              immediately
  -e, --fail-early          Fail command immediately after first deployment
                              problem instead of waiting for timeout on client
                              or backend side
                            There are certain scenarios when deployment can
                              succeed despite reported deployment problems.
                            This means that even if you receive early warning
                              messages about deployment failures, the
                              application might still start up and run properly
                              later.
  -h, --help                Show this help message and exit.
  -l, --logs                Shows application deployment logs in real-time
      --reset=<removedParameters>
                            Properties to reset to default value or remove
  -t, --timeout=<seconds>   Sets how long to wait for deployment completion on
                              the client side.
                            This timeout doesn't affect the actual deployment
                              process in Payara Qube, so applications might
                              still start up even after a timeout occurs.
  -V, --version             Print version information and exit.
