= Payara Cloud Pricing

== Overview

Payara Cloud uses a simple pricing model based on virtual CPU (vCPU) core usage.
Usage is measured per minute and billed in 30-day cycles.

- Minimum allocation: 0.25 vCPU cores
- Maximum allocation per application: 4 vCPU cores
- Base rate: $0.005 per vCPU core per minute (with volume discounts available)

== Cost Examples

=== Minimal Development Setup

* Configuration: 0.25 vCPU cores
* Monthly cost: *$54*
* Can be optimized by xref:how-to-guides/application/Deploying an Application.adoc[starting/stopping] the application as needed

=== Single Production Application

* Configuration: 2 vCPU cores

> Monthly cost: $0.005 * 2 * 60 * 24 * 30 = *$432*

Recommended minimum for production workloads

=== Large Scale Application
Configuration:

* 2 applications × 2 vCPU cores each
* 1 application × 0.5 vCPU cores

> Total: 4.5 vCPU cores

Monthly cost breakdown:

1. First 2 cores: $0.005 * 2 * 60 * 24 * 30 = *$432*
2. Next 2 cores: $0.00477 * 2 * 60 * 24 * 30 = *$400*
3. Additional 0.5 cores: $0.00445 * 0.5 * 60 * 24 * 30 = *$96.12*

> Total Monthly Cost: *$928.12*

== Notes
- All prices are in USD
- Billing occurs in 30-day cycles
- Usage is calculated per minute
- Applications can be scaled up or down within plan limits
- Consider automated start/stop (through xref:cli:user-guide.adoc[pcl]) scheduling to optimize costs
