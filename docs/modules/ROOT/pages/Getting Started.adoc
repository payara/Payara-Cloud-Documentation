Using the Payara Cloud environment requires a user account that is linked to a _Subscription_. A _Subscription_ is a unit for billing purposes. For the product launch, Payara Cloud allows a single user account to access your subscription. A future feature will allow you to add multiple users with different access levels to your account.

After selecting your subscription (Basic, Standard, Premium), you’re taken to the Payara Cloud sign up page where you can create an account (Click ‘sign up’ where it says Don’t have an account?) or you can choose to continue creating an account with Google or GitHub.

If you choose to sign up rather than use Google or GitHub to create your account, you’re presented with a welcome screen to choose your Username and password. Please note your username can only contain 14 characters, letters and digits, with no spaces or special characters such as &, @, %.
