= How To Manage Access Levels

Payara Cloud incorporates a role-based access control system, enabling the assignment of specific permissions to different users.
This guide outlines the roles available in Payara Cloud and their application in common scenarios.

== Understanding Roles
// === Roles In Payara Cloud

Payara Cloud categorizes users into distinct roles, each with a set of permissions tailored to their responsibilities:

|===
| Role | Purpose

| Billing Manager
| Handles financial aspects, like viewing invoices and managing payment methods, and also users, but without application management capabilities.

| Administrator
| Possesses full access to applications, configurations, and user role management, including namespace-specific roles.

| Billing Manager with Administrative Privilege
| Combines the permissions of both Billing Manager and Administrator.

| Manager
| Manages applications within namespaces, including deployment and deletion.

| Operator
| Focuses on application reconfiguration and diagnostics, without deletion rights or access to sensitive configurations.
| Viewer
| Only views deployed applications without modification rights.

| No Access
| Does not have permission to use Payara Cloud by default.
This can be overridden by granting specific namespace access
|===


Payara Cloud distinguishes two primary roles at its highest level: Billing Manager and Administrator.
A Billing Manager, typically from the finance department, manages payment details and views invoices.
An Administrator, a technical role, oversees application and namespace management, including the unique ability to manage namespace-specific roles.
Both of these roles however, are capable of managing users' roles

Administrators also controls the namespaces.
Only they can create new namespaces, manage roles within them, set up custom domains or delete namespaces.

=== Role Scopes

There are three scopes of roles in Payara Cloud:

Subscription Role::
This is the default role assigned to the user unless overridden in other scopes.

Namespace Default User Role::
Overrides the Subscription Role within a specific namespace.

User's Role::
The most specific role assigned to particular user in single namespace.

It's noteworthy that the Namespace Default User Role can restrict permissions more than the Subscription Role, emphasizing the system's flexibility in access management.

Role scopes are applicable only to roles other than Administrator; the subscription role of an Administrator cannot be changed.

== Typical Usage Scenarios

Let's walk through some typical scenarios of managing permissions, from the most loose to the most strict.

=== General Access

In smaller teams, granting everyone the Billing Manager with Administrative Privilege role simplifies operations.

=== Financial Oversight

Assigning Billing Manager roles to those handling finances separates payment management from application oversight.

=== Controlled Deployment

If you have a person responsible for payments, but managing applications and deployments is not within their role, make them a Billing Manager.
They will have no access to application management or namespace permissions at all.

=== Operational Oversight

Once your project involves customer-facing workloads and a larger team, tightening the deployment process to specific namespaces becomes essential.
This entails limiting Administrator roles, as namespace-specific role overrides do not apply to Administrators.

Typically, team members are designated as Managers, with a select few serving as Administrators capable of creating namespaces and managing roles.

For the production namespace, setting the default user role to Viewer restricts deployment capabilities to Administrators only, allowing other team members to view metrics and logs.
To delegate deployment responsibilities within the production environment, a non-administrator can be assigned the Manager role in that specific namespace.

=== Operational Runs

For individuals tasked with monitoring and initial incident response, assigning them the Operator role at the namespace level is suitable.
This role permits them to analyze and adjust the application settings without the ability to delete the application or access confidential configuration details.
Furthermore, while Operators can obtain heap dumps, regarded as sensitive data, only Managers have the authority to download these dumps.

=== View-only Access

In case a developer needs access to production system, but should not be able to change anything, you would assign them Viewer role in the production namespace.
In addition to logs and basic metrics, they would be able to see the configuration of the application sans the sensitive properties, but not change it.
They can also acquire dumps, but only Managers can download them.

=== No Access

To completely restrict access to a namespace, you would assign No Access as Namespace Default User role.
Then only users with user roles in that namespace (and Administrators) would be able to access it.

=== Siloed Operations

The most strict scenario would be explicitly controlling what non-administrator users can do.
They would have Subscription Role set to No Access.

On development namespace, you would assign Default Namespace Role of Manager.
You could trim down access to specific users by assigning them Operator role in that namespace if necessary.

On QA namespace, the Default Namespace Role could be Operator or Viewer.
Only Administrators would be able to deploy there, or some users would get Manager role.

Similar access control would be performed on production.

Less strict variant would be assigning Viewer subscription role to everyone.
