= Application Communication

Payara Cloud designates a distinct domain under payara.app for each namespace, like  \https://staging-118842.payara.app.
In this namespace, apps are deployed at specific xref:how-to-guides/application/Configure Application.adoc#internet-accessible-paths[paths]. For instance, an app named foo will be deployed at \https://staging-118842.payara.app/foo.

Apps within the same namespace can interact using the URL format \http://deployedAppName/contextRoot/someEndpoint.

== Custom Domain Linking

You can link xref:how-to-guides/How to Use Custom Domains.adoc[custom domains] to a namespace. For example, myApp.foocompany.com can point to \https://staging-118842.payara.app. Once linked, foo app becomes accessible at \https://myApp.foocompany.com/foo.

== Context Root Definition

By default, the app's context root is either the application name or a path specified in glassfish-web.xml.
Apps can also designate a sub-path for external exposure, like app-context-root/public, keeping other paths like app-context-root/api internal.

== Setting up Communication Between Applications

Assume `bar` and `bazz` are deployed to the same namespace on Payara Cloud, with `bar` exposing a REST endpoint api/finance that `bazz` consumes. The following sections illustrate their communication setup.

=== Deploying `bar` and `bazz`

Deploy both apps to a namespace, say \https://staging-118842.payara.app, making them accessible at \https://staging-118842.payara.app/`bar` and \https://staging-118842.payara.app/`bazz`.

If a custom domain foocompany.com is configured, the apps are available at \https://foocompany.com/bar and \https://foocompany.com/bazz respectively.

=== Accessing Endpoint in `bazz`

`bazz` can access `bars` /api/finance endpoint at the internal address http://`bar`/`bar`/api/finance. This address utilizes the app name and context root for in-namespace routing.

Below is a code snippet demonstrating a call from `bar` to `bazz`'s api/finance endpoint:



[source,java]
----
public class FinanceApiClient {

    public  void doSomeFinance() {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create("http://bar/bar/api/finance"))
                .GET()
                .build();
            HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
            if (response.statusCode() == 200) {
               //Do custom work with the response
            }

    }
}
----

=== Use MicroProfile Config For Utmost Flexibility

Employ MicroProfile Config properties to specify the endpoints, allowing different server URLs during development and production. With this setup, xref:docs:ROOT:getting-started/Deploying an Application.adoc#review-configuration[app deployment configuration] on Payara Cloud can override these properties.

Hereâ€™s how the above snippet can be adapted to use MicroProfile Config properties:

[source,java]
----
public class FinanceApiClient {

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name="`bar`.finance.endpoint")
    String resourceUrl;

    public  void doSomeFinance() {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create(resourceUrl))
                .GET()
                .build();
            HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
            if (response.statusCode() == 200) {
               //Do custom work with the response
            }

    }
}
----

With this setup, different URLs can be passed dynamically without redeploying the app. Modify this property anytime on the Payara Cloud dashboard to suit your needs.
