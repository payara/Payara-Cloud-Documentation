= Managing Subscriptions in Payara Cloud

Payara Cloud uses subscriptions as the primary billing unit. All application usage across your various namespaces gets consolidated into a single invoice, simplifying the billing process.
A single Billing Manager can oversee multiple subscriptions, which can be associated with different companies and use various payment methods.

== Starting a New Subscription

=== Free Trial
For new users, the best way to begin is with our 15-day free trial. You won't be charged during this period. A detailed guide to get you started is available here: xref:docs:ROOT:getting-started/cloud-trial/Signup Payara Cloud.adoc[].

During the trial, you can use:

* Up to a total of 4 vCPUs and 8GB RAM across all your applications.
* Individual application runtime sizes ranging from 0.25 vCPU to 2 vCPU.

Billing automatically starts at the end of the trial based on the plan you choose or default to if none is selected.

=== Existing Users
If you're an already using Payara Cloud, you can easily create additional subscriptions. You have the option to either link:additional.adoc[reuse existing invoicing data] or link:additional.adoc[provide new invoicing data] for these new subscriptions.

== Subscription Tiers and vCPU Limits

Payara Cloud billing is based on the total vCPU resources consumed by your applications over time, measured in vCPU-minutes. Each subscription tier has a maximum limit or a prepaid amount of vCPU resources you can use across *all* your deployed applications within that subscription.

Billing periods are based on 30-day cycles. The base unit for prepaid calculation is the number of minutes one vCPU runs over this period:
*Calculation:* 1 vCPU * 30 days * 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = *43,200 vCPU-minutes per vCPU*.

Think of the vCPU limit as a total budget for your subscription. Every application you deploy consumes a portion of this budget based on its configured runtime size (e.g., 0.25 vCPU, 1 vCPU, 2 vCPU).

=== Pay As You Go
* **Ideal for:** Standalone applications or small environments with variable usage.
* **vCPU Limit:** Maximum **2 vCPU** total simultaneous usage across all applications.
* **RAM Limit:** Maximum **4 GB** total simultaneous usage.
* **Allowed Runtime Sizes:** 0.25 vCPU to 2 vCPU per application.
* **Cost:** $0/month base fee.
* **Overage:** $0.005 per vCPU-minute consumed.

*Mental Model:* With the Pay As You Go tier, you have a hard cap of 2 vCPUs in total at any given time.
* Example 1: You can run one application at 2 vCPU.
* Example 2: You can run a development instance at 0.5 vCPU and a production instance at 1.5 vCPU (0.5 + 1.5 = 2 vCPU total).
* Example 3: You could run four small applications at 0.5 vCPU each (4 * 0.5 = 2 vCPU total).
* You *cannot* run two applications at 1.5 vCPU each, as that would be 3 vCPU total, exceeding the 2 vCPU limit.

=== Standard
* **Ideal for:** Teams and businesses with constantly running applications needing predictable costs.
* **Prepaid Resources:** Includes **2 vCPU** and **4 GB RAM**. This prepaid vCPU amount equates to 2 * 43,200 = *86,400 vCPU-minutes* over a 30-day cycle.
* **Allowed Runtime Sizes:** 0.25 vCPU to 4 vCPU per application.
* **Cost:** $432/month (covers the prepaid resources).
* **Overage:** $0.00405 per vCPU-minute consumed *above* the prepaid 86,400 minutes.

*Mental Model:* The Standard tier gives you a prepaid budget equivalent to running 2 vCPUs constantly for 30 days (86,400 vCPU-minutes). You can configure individual applications up to 4 vCPUs, but your *average* usage across all applications should stay near 2 vCPU to avoid extra charges.
* Example 1: Running two applications at 1 vCPU each continuously would consume exactly the prepaid amount.
* Example 2: Running four applications at 0.5 vCPU each continuously would also consume the prepaid amount.
* Example 3: Running one application at 3 vCPU continuously would use the prepaid 2 vCPU amount and incur overage charges for the extra 1 vCPU of usage.

=== Premium
* **Ideal for:** Larger applications needing a supported environment and access to the Payara Services support team.
* **Prepaid Resources:** Includes **16 vCPU** and **32 GB RAM**. This prepaid vCPU amount equates to 16 * 43,200 = *691,200 vCPU-minutes* over a 30-day cycle.
* **Allowed Runtime Sizes:** 0.25 vCPU to 4 vCPU per application.
* **Includes:** Multiple custom domains, Payara Micro Enterprise binaries, Access to Payara Services support team.
* **Cost:** $3300/month (covers the prepaid resources and support).
* **Overage:** $0.0044 per vCPU-minute consumed *above* the prepaid 691,200 minutes.

*Mental Model:* The Premium tier provides a large prepaid budget equivalent to running 16 vCPUs constantly for 30 days (691,200 vCPU-minutes).
* Example 1: Running four applications at 4 vCPU each continuously would consume the prepaid amount.
* Example 2: Running sixteen applications at 1 vCPU each continuously would also consume the prepaid amount.
* Example 3: Running five applications at 4 vCPU each (total 20 vCPU) continuously would use the prepaid 16 vCPU amount and incur overage charges for the extra 4 vCPU of usage.

=== Optimizing vCPU Usage
To manage costs and stay within your tier's limits or prepaid amounts:

* **Right-size your applications:** Choose the smallest runtime size (vCPU/RAM) that meets your application's performance needs. Don't overallocate resources.
* **Scale down non-essential environments:** Reduce the vCPU allocation for development, testing, or staging environments when they are not actively used, or stop them entirely.
* **Monitor your consumption:** Regularly check the Payara Cloud dashboard to understand your current vCPU usage patterns across all applications and namespaces within the subscription.
* **Consolidate applications:** If feasible, consider running multiple related applications within a single, slightly larger runtime instance instead of many small instances.

=== Exceeding vCPU Limits
* **Pay As You Go:** If your total simultaneous vCPU usage attempts to exceed the 2 vCPU limit, deployment or scaling operations might fail. You will need to reduce the vCPU allocation of existing applications before deploying or scaling new ones.
* **Standard & Premium:** If your total vCPU-minute consumption exceeds the prepaid amount for the 30-day billing cycle, you will be charged the specified overage rate per vCPU-minute for the excess usage. You will typically see notifications within the Payara Cloud console dashboard indicating that you are consuming resources beyond your prepaid limit and incurring overage charges.

== Invoicing

Payara Cloud issues invoices based on 30-day cycles, which include:

.   **Fixed Monthly Fee (Standard & Premium):** Charged in advance for the upcoming 30-day billing period, covering the prepaid vCPU-minutes and features of the tier.
.   **Variable Fee (All Tiers with Overage):** Charged in arrears for any vCPU-minute usage that exceeded your plan's prepaid volume (or any usage for Pay As You Go) in the *previous* 30-day billing period.

Because billing periods are based on 30-day cycles, they do not always align perfectly with calendar months.

== Cancelling Subscription

A subscription can be cancelled at any time by following the procedure listed here: xref:docs:ROOT:getting-started/cloud-trial/Cancel Payara Cloud.adoc[].

== Payment Options

Payara Cloud accepts both credit and debit card payments. We use Stripe as our trusted payment processor to ensure secure transactions.
