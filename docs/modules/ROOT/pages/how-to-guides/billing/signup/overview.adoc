= Managing Subscriptions in Payara Cloud

Payara Cloud uses subscriptions as the primary billing unit. All application usage across your various namespaces gets consolidated into a single invoice, simplifying the billing process.
A single Billing Manager can oversee multiple subscriptions, which can be associated with different companies and use various payment methods.

== Subscription Tiers and vCPU Limits

Payara Cloud billing is based on the total vCPU (virtual CPU) resources consumed by your applications over time, measured in vCPU-minutes.
Each subscription tier has a maximum limit or a prepaid amount of vCPU resources you can use across *all* your deployed applications within that subscription.

[NOTE]
Free trial offers higher resources (4 vCPU/8GB) than Pay As You Go (2 vCPU/4GB) specifically to let you test horizontal scaling scenarios,
such as running two 2-vCPU instances simultaneously, before committing to a paid plan.

=== Understanding Your vCPU Budget

The basic billing unit in Payara Cloud is vCPU-minutes, calculated as:

* 1 vCPU running for 1 minute = 1 vCPU-minute
* For a 30-day billing period, the calculation is:
** 1 vCPU × 30 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 43,200 vCPU-minutes

This means:

* Standard tier's 2 vCPU prepaid allocation = 2 × 43,200 = 86,400 vCPU-minutes
* Premium tier's 16 vCPU prepaid allocation = 16 × 43,200 = 691,200 vCPU-minutes

=== Free Trial
* *Duration:* 15 days with no charges
* *Total vCPU limit:* 4 vCPUs across all applications
* *Example allocations:*
** One application at 4 vCPU
** Two applications at 2 vCPU each
** Four applications at 1 vCPU each
** Eight applications at 0.5 vCPU each
* Billing automatically starts at the end of trial based on your chosen plan

=== Pay As You Go
* *Hard cap:* Maximum 2 vCPU total simultaneous usage
* *Examples of valid allocations:*
** One application at 2 vCPU
** One application at 1.5 vCPU + one at 0.5 vCPU
** Four applications at 0.5 vCPU each
* *Examples that exceed limit:*
** Two applications at 1.5 vCPU each (3 vCPU total - exceeds limit)
** Three applications at 1 vCPU each (3 vCPU total - exceeds limit)
* *Notification:* When attempting to deploy an application that would exceed the 2 vCPU limit, you'll receive an error message stating: "Deployment failed: Total vCPU allocation would exceed your subscription limit of 2 vCPU."

=== Standard
* *Prepaid amount:* 2 vCPU running continuously (86,400 vCPU-minutes per 30 days)
* *Examples of allocations within prepaid amount:*
** Two applications at 1 vCPU each running continuously
** Four applications at 0.5 vCPU each running continuously
** One application at 2 vCPU running continuously
* *Examples requiring additional payment:*
** Three applications at 1 vCPU each running continuously (1 vCPU over prepaid amount)
** One application at 3 vCPU running continuously (1 vCPU over prepaid amount)
* *Notification:* When your usage exceeds the prepaid amount, you'll see a dashboard alert: "You are now consuming resources beyond your prepaid limit and incurring additional charges."

=== Premium
* *Prepaid amount:* 16 vCPU running continuously (691,200 vCPU-minutes per 30 days)
* *Examples of allocations within prepaid amount:*
** Four applications at 4 vCPU each running continuously
** Sixteen applications at 1 vCPU each running continuously
** Eight applications at 2 vCPU each running continuously
* *Examples requiring additional payment:*
** Five applications at 4 vCPU each (20 vCPU total - 4 over prepaid amount)
** Twenty applications at 1 vCPU each (4 vCPU over prepaid amount)
* *Notification:* Same as Standard tier - dashboard alerts will appear when usage exceeds prepaid amount

== Optimizing Your vCPU Usage

To manage costs and stay within your tier's limits or prepaid amounts:

* *Right-size your applications:* Choose the smallest runtime size that meets your application's performance needs
* *Scale down non-essential environments:* Use smaller vCPU allocations (0.25-0.5) for development and testing
* *Monitor your consumption:* Regularly check your dashboard to identify resource-intensive applications
* *Consolidate applications:* When possible, run multiple small applications within one larger instance

== Starting a New Subscription

=== Free Trial
For new users, the best way to begin is with our 15-day free trial. A detailed guide to get you started is available here: xref:docs:ROOT:getting-started/cloud-trial/Signup Payara Cloud.adoc[].

=== Existing Users
If you're already using Payara Cloud, you can easily create additional subscriptions by either link:additional.adoc[reusing existing invoicing data] or link:additional.adoc[providing new invoicing data].

== Invoicing

Payara Cloud issues invoices based on 30-day cycles, which include:

. *Fixed Monthly Fee (Standard & Premium):* Charged in advance for the upcoming billing period
. *Variable Fee (All Tiers):* Covers any usage exceeding your plan's prepaid volume in the previous billing period

== Cancelling Subscription

A subscription can be cancelled at any time by following the procedure listed here: xref:docs:ROOT:getting-started/cloud-trial/Cancel Payara Cloud.adoc[].
