= Payara Cloud Azure Customer Managed Region

The Payara Cloud Azure Customer Managed Region feature allows you to deploy your applications to a dedicated, private cloud region within your own Azure account, providing more control and isolation compared to a shared cloud environment.

In essence, this service enables you to use Payara Cloud's managed Jakarta EE capabilities while maintaining your applications within your own Azure infrastructure.

== Setting Up Your Payara Cloud Customer Managed Region on Azure

This guide will walk you through deploying a Payara Cloud Customer Managed Region on Azure, allowing you to run your Jakarta EE applications in a dedicated, private cloud environment.

=== Prerequisites

* Public DNS Domain: You'll need a domain you control to create a subdomain for your Payara Cloud region.
* Azure Subscription: You must have an active Azure subscription to deploy the managed application.


=== Step-by-Step Setup

==== Sign Up for Payara Cloud

. Go to the Payara Cloud signup page.
. Create an account using your preferred method (username/password, GitHub, or Google).

If you already have a Payara Cloud account, login instead.

==== Deploy the Managed Application on Azure

. In the Azure portal, under My Market Place, click on plans and search for and select the "Payara Cloud Customer Managed Region" managed application.

. Provide the following required parameters:
*** Payara Cloud Connection String: Paste the connection string you copied earlier.
*** Domain to Create: Enter the subdomain you want to use (e.g., 'payara.yourdomain.com').
*** Let's Encrypt Email: Provide an email associated with your Let's Encrypt certificates.
. Deploy the managed application.

==== Configure DNS

. Once the deployment is complete, note the dns_nameservers output from the application.
. In your DNS provider's settings for your main domain, create an NS record pointing your subdomain (e.g., 'payara') to the provided nameservers.

==== Verify and Deploy Applications

. Back in Payara Cloud, go to "Subscription Management" and ensure your new region is "Active."
. Navigate to "Application Management" and create a new namespace, selecting your custom region.
. xref:docs:ROOT:how-to-guides/application/Deploying an Application.adoc[Upload] your Jakarta EE web application (WAR file).
. Select "Deploy Immediately" and click "Upload."
. Once deployed, you can access your application using the provided URL.

=== Important Notes

If you encounter a certificate error, it might be because the Let's Encrypt certificate hasn't been issued yet.
Make sure your DNS settings are correct, and wait a few minutes.
You can monitor application logs within the Payara Cloud interface.
