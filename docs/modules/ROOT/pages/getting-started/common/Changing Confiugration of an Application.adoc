== Make Changes to Your Application’s Configuration and Redeploy

* Start on the Application detail screen for the application you wish to change.
* Click the btn:[Application Actions] button.
* Choose btn:[Edit Configuration]
* Make your changes on the configuration screen, click btn:[Save] to create a revision of your application.



After saving your configuration changes, you’ll see the updated application details screen with a new revision number, and the revision history. Your latest revision will show configured – but not deployed. (The previously deployed revision of your application is still live until you deploy the changes).
