= Payara Qube Installation Guide

== Overview

This documentation will walk you through the complete installation process for Payara Qube, from getting installation files to setting up your first organization.
The installation uses Pulumi for infrastructure management and deploys on AWS.

== Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have:

* AWS CLI client configured with appropriate administrative permissions
* Access to your Nexus credentials (provided in welcome package)
* https://www.pulumi.com[Pulumi] installed on your machine (or the machine from which you run the commands)
* npm and Helm (may be required depending on your system)

== Getting Installation Files

Follow the following steps

1. Navigate to https://billing.payara.cloud/install-qube/wizard as instructed in your welcome package
2. Enter your Nexus credentials when prompted

3. Define a name for your installation — this will prefix all AWS resources created
+

4. Configure DNS settings:

image::docs:ROOT:qube/installation/qube-install-3.png[DNS Definition Page,width=624,height=257,link="{imagesdir}/qube/installation/qube-install-3.png", window="_blank"]
Configure DNS settings using the following format
+
[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Field |Example

|**Control Plane Domain**
|`stackName.control.example.com` +
Example: If your stack name is "mycompany", enter `mycompany.control.example.com`

|**Control Plane Zone**
|`control.example.com` +
This is the parent zone that must exist in your AWS account

|**Application Domain**
|`stackName.apps.example.com` +
Example: If your stack name is "mycompany", enter `mycompany.apps.example.com`

|**Application Zone**
|`apps.example.com` +
This is the parent zone for application deployments

|**LetsEncrypt Contact Email**
|`admin@example.com` +
Replace with your actual email address for SSL certificate notifications
|===
+
* **Control Plane DNS Zone** must be present and modifiable in your current AWS account
* **Application DNS Zone** should also be present for single-step installation (optional but recommended)
+
The DNS configuration follows a hierarchical structure where your stack name becomes a subdomain of the provided zones. This allows multiple installations to coexist within the same AWS account while maintaining proper DNS resolution.

5. Review the SMTP Provider Settings

6. Review the default instance settings—avoid using instances smaller than 2-CPU as they can cause deployment timeouts

7. Set your Region ID (typically matches stack ID) and Region Description

== Pulumi Configuration

=== Choosing State Management

Pulumi offers several options for storing infrastructure state:

* **Pulumi Cloud** (recommended): Secure online service for team use
* **S3 bucket**: Store state in AWS S3 or other cloud storage
* **Local storage**: Not recommended for production use

Consult the https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/concepts/state-and-backends/[Managing State documentation] for detailed configuration options.

=== Authentication Setup

==== AWS Login
Ensure your default AWS profile or environment variables have administrative permissions for your target account.

==== Pulumi Login
Choose the appropriate command based on your state backend:

[source,bash]
----
# For Pulumi Cloud
pulumi login

# For Azure Blob storage (example)
pulumi login azblob://pulumi/?storage_account=stacc

# For local storage (not recommended)
pulumi login --local
----

== Installation Environment Setup

. Extract the downloaded installation files to a directory
. Consider version controlling this directory for team collaboration

=== Stack Initialization

[source,bash]
----
# Initialize the stack (replace 'qb02' with your chosen name)
pulumi stack init qb02

# Synchronize configuration
pulumi refresh -y
----

=== Optional: Change Encryption Provider

If you prefer a different encryption provider, run:

[source,bash]
----
pulumi stack change-secrets-provider
----

Refer to the https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/cli/commands/pulumi_stack_change-secrets-provider/[official documentation] for available providers.

=== Nexus Credentials

The `.npmrc` file contains base64-encoded credentials. You may want to move the second line to your home directory's `.npmrc` for system-wide access.

=== Install Pulumi SDK

[source,bash]
----
pulumi install
----

== Infrastructure Deployment

Start the deployment process:

[source,bash]
----
pulumi up
----

The deployment process will:

. Show a preview of planned changes
. Wait for your confirmation
. Execute the deployment (approximately 45 minutes)

NOTE: Due to the eventually consistent nature of Kubernetes and AWS, you may need to run `pulumi up` multiple times if initial attempts encounter timing issues.

=== Monitoring Deployment

* Green text doesn't always indicate complete success - check for errors in the output
* Look for a return code of 0 and no errors in the diagnostics section
* The process is complete when you see a success message without errors

== DNS Configuration

If both parent domains were in your AWS account, DNS configuration is automatic. Otherwise, you need to manually configure NS records.

. Check the AWS Route 53 console for your hosted zone details
. Note the nameservers for your application domain
. Create NS records in the parent domain pointing to these nameservers

The installation will not complete successfully until domains resolve publicly on the internet.

== Troubleshooting Common Issues

=== AWS Credentials Error
[source]
----
error: unable to validate AWS credentials
----

**Solution**: Check your AWS credentials with `aws sts get-caller-identity`

=== Helm Timeout Error
[source]
----
error: Helm release failed to initialize completely
----

**Solution**: Run `pulumi up` again or investigate using Helm CLI

=== Domain Resolution Issues
[source]
----
qb02-import-realm failing/timing out
----

**Solution**: Ensure your domain resolves on the internet. Keycloak must be accessible at `users.control.plane.domain.com` with a valid TLS certificate.

== Post-Installation Configuration

=== Access Installation Outputs

View your installation details:

[source,bash]
----
pulumi stack output --show-secrets
----

This displays important information including:
* `userManagementUrl`: Keycloak admin interface
* `managementUrl`: Payara Qube management interface
* `userManagementAdminUser` and `userManagementAdminPassword`: Initial admin credentials

=== Keycloak Administrator Setup

. Visit the `userManagementUrl` with the provided admin credentials
. Create a permanent admin account:
* Navigate to **Users** > **Add User**
* Fill in the username and create the user
* Go to **Credentials** > **Set Password** and set a secure password
* In **Role Mapping** > **Assign role**, switch to **Filter by realm roles** and assign the admin role

. Optional: Disable the initial admin account for security

=== Payara Qube Organization Administrator
The Payara Qube  xref:docs:ROOT:user-guides/qube/qube-organisation-management.adoc[] doc has full end-to-end information about managing organizations in Payara Qube via Keycloak.

=== Optional: Enable User Self-Registration

To allow users to register themselves:

. In Keycloak, go to **Realm Settings** > **Login**
. Toggle **User registration** to enabled

== Creating Your First Organization

. Navigate to the `managementUrl` from your stack outputs
. Log in with your organization admin credentials
. You'll be directed to the **Organization Management** screen
. Click to create a new organization and provide a name
. Enter the organization and go to **Manage Users**
. Add users by specifying their email addresses

NOTE: Email configuration is not yet automated in this installation process.
You'll need to manually send invitation links to new users, who will then register through Keycloak.

== Next Steps

Your Payara Qube installation is now complete! Organization administrators can:

* Create and manage namespaces
* Invite and manage users within their organization
* Configure additional settings as needed

Users will be redirected to Keycloak for account registration and can then access their assigned namespaces through the Payara Qube interface.
