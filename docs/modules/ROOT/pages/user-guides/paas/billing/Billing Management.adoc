Enter their email address and select the role they should have in the subscription once they accept it.
The option to grant Administrative privileges to a Billing Manager is only available when the Billing Manager role is selected.
Only a Billing Manager can grant or remove Billing Manager roles in the subscription.

Click btn:[Add User] to send an invitation email to the provided email address.
The user's email will appear in the list with a status of _Pending_.

Following the link btn:[Signup to Payara Cloud] will lead to the signup prompt.

The email used for registration does *not* need to match the email to which the invitation was sent.
Users can also choose to use their existing Google or GitHub account instead ❷.
Signup will fail if the user already has an account.
In such a case, they need to select "Already have an account? btn:[Log in]" ❶.

Afterward, their invitation is accepted.

btn:[Go To Subscription] will take them to the link:../overview.html[Subscription Overview].

The user will be listed as _Active_ on the <<Manage Subscription Users Screen,user list screen>> after accepting.
Acceptance of the invitation may fail if the user is already a member of the subscription, even if they are <<Enabling or Disabling a User, disabled>>.

=== Other Means of Inviting

If the invited user misses the invitation email, the menu action btn:[Resend Invite] allows for resending the email and also changing the email address of the user being invited.

Clicking btn:[Copy Invitation Link] will bring you to a page that lists the invitation link the user should follow.
With that, you can transfer the link by other means, i.e., instant message.
The invitation link is for single use only; no further verification is performed when visiting it, so ensure no unauthorized actors obtain it.
Specifically, Payara Cloud Support will never ask you for the invitation link.

=== Editing a User

Click btn:[Edit User] to view the properties of the respective user of this subscription.

On this screen, you can change the user's role.
Confirm the updates by clicking btn:[Update User].

When updating, the <<Manage Subscription Users Screen, requirements>> for role staffing need to be maintained; otherwise, the update will fail.
Only a Billing Manager can grant or remove Billing Manager roles in the subscription.

New roles will take effect the next time the user logs in.

==== Enabling or Disabling a User

By un-clicking the checkbox btn:[Active], the user will become _Inactive_.
An inactive user has no permissions in the subscription.
For them, the effect is the same as if they were <<Removing a User, removed>>, however, it's possible to restore their permissions by re-enabling btn:[Active] without needing to invite the user again.

=== Removing a User

To completely remove a user, select the btn:[Remove User] option from the action menu for the respective user.

NOTE: This action cannot be undone.
The user will need to be invited again to regain access to the subscription.
To temporarily remove a user, consider <<Enabling or Disabling a User,disabling>> the user instead.

Confirmation is required to complete the removal:

Upon confirmation, the user will be removed from the subscription, and their access will be revoked.
They will need to be re-invited to regain access to the subscription.
