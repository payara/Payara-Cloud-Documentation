= Manage Users

{productName} enables you to have multiple users accessing your subscription.
To facilitate this, you invite users to your subscription via email.
Upon receiving the invitation, they can register for a new {productName} account or use their existing one to access the subscription.

== Roles

In {productName}, users can have different roles, each with its own set of permissions:

Roles defined as:

Billing Manager::
Users with this role have access to all billing and payment information related to the subscription.
They can also invite new users to the subscription and modify their roles, though they may not have permissions to deploy applications to {productName}.

Administrator::
Administrators possess full permissions to deploy and configure applications on {productName}.
They can also invite new users to the subscription and modify their roles.

Billing Manager with Administrative Privileges::
This role combines the privileges of both the Billing Manager and Administrator roles, providing all available permissions.
When you sign up for {productName}, this is the default role assigned to your subscription.

Manager::
Has full access to existing {productName}â€™s namespaces, can upload new and delete existing applications.

Operator::	Can reconfigure and diagnose deployed applications but cannot delete them. Also cannot access restricted (sensitive) configuration properties.

Viewer::
Has read only access to deployed applications

No Access::
Does not have access to {productName}. You may want to override this role on per-namespace basis to only allow access to specific namespaces to a user.

This requirement can also be satisfied by a single user with the Billing Manager with Administrative Privileges role.
