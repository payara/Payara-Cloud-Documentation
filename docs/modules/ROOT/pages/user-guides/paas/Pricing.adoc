= Payara Cloud Pricing and Subscriptions

Payara Cloud uses subscriptions as the primary billing unit.
All application usage across your various namespaces gets consolidated into a single invoice, simplifying the billing process.
A single Billing Manager can oversee multiple subscriptions, which can be associated with different companies and use various payment methods.

== Subscription Tiers and vCPU Limits

Payara Cloud billing is based on the total vCPU (virtual CPU) resources consumed by your applications over time, measured in vCPU-minutes.
Each subscription tier has a maximum limit or a prepaid amount of vCPU resources you can use across *all* your deployed applications within that subscription.

[NOTE]
Free trial offers higher resources (4 vCPU/8GB) than Pay As You Go (2 vCPU/4GB) specifically to let you test horizontal scaling scenarios,
such as running two 2-vCPU instances simultaneously, before committing to a paid plan.

=== Understanding Your vCPU Budget

The basic billing unit in Payara Cloud is vCPU-minutes, calculated as:

* 1 vCPU running for 1 minute = 1 vCPU-minute
* For a 30-day billing period, the calculation is:
** 1 vCPU × 30 days × 24 hours/day × 60 minutes/hour = 43,200 vCPU-minutes

This means:

* Standard tier's 2 vCPU prepaid allocation = 2 × 43,200 = 86,400 vCPU-minutes
* Premium tier's 16 vCPU prepaid allocation = 16 × 43,200 = 691,200 vCPU-minutes

== Optimizing Your vCPU Usage

To manage costs and stay within your tier's limits or prepaid amounts:

* *Right-size your applications:* Choose the smallest runtime size that meets your application's performance needs
* *Scale down non-essential environments:* Use smaller vCPU allocations (0.25-0.5) for development and testing
* *Monitor your consumption:* Regularly check your dashboard to identify resource-intensive applications
* *Consolidate applications:* When possible, run multiple small applications within one larger instance
