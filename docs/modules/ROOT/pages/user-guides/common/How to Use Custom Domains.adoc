= How to Use Custom Domains

{productName} offers customers on the Standard or Premium subscription tiers the ability to associate custom domains to namespaces.
This feature enhances the accessibility of your applications deployed to such namespaces for end users, by providing a personalized and easily recognizable URL.

When applications are uploaded to a specific namespace in {productName}, a default URL is created.
This URL is formed by concatenating your namespace and application names, resulting in a link like: \https://guide-docu-6696a94c.payara.app/demo (Note: This is a fabricated URL for illustration purposes).

However, these auto-generated URLs may not always align with your brand or be user-friendly, which is why the custom domain feature is valuable.
It allows you to transform the default URL into a more brand-centric and user-friendly format such as \https://yourAmazingBrand.com/app1, \https://yourAmazingBrand.com/app2, and so on, simplifying the way end users access your deployed applications.

== Add A Custom Domain
Select the namespace containing your application from the Namespace Navigator. In the btn:[Namespace Actions] drop down menu, click btn:[Custom Domain]

[NOTE]
The top-level domain name feature requires the domain registrar to support CNAME at the zone apex.
This allows you to map the namespace URL directly to the root of the domain.
Providers like Cloudflare use CNAME flattening to make such mapping possible.
Check with your provider for details on setting CNAME records to the root of your domain.



For instance, if using Cloudflare as your domain host, create a new CNAME record in your domain dashboard as shown.

[checklist]
* ❶ Set record type to CNAME
* ❷ Enter root domain name. Some providers also allow the use of the '@' symbol as a shorthand
* ❸ Paste the DNS record value copied from {productName}'s custom domain screen
* ❹ Save

Return to the custom domain setup screen in {productName}.

Click btn:[Check DNS]

Your namespace should now be linked to the configured domain.

NOTE: DNS propagation duration may vary based on your domain name provider, taking anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours. Check DNS propagation using online tools such as https://dnschecker.org/

With the custom domain configured, all applications deployed to the namespace can be accessed as sub-paths of the set domain.
For instance, an application deployed to the context path myapp1 would be accessible via the URL \https://jakarta101.com/myapp1.

== Edit/Remove Custom Domain
You can always edit or remove configured domains for namespaces on the Custom Domain page.
