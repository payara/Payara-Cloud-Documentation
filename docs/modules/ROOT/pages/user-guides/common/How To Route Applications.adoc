= Application Communication

{productName} designates a distinct domain under payara.app for each namespace, like  \https://staging-118842.payara.app.
In this namespace, apps are deployed at specific xref:user-guides/common/application/Configure Application.adoc#internet-accessible-paths[paths].
For instance, an app named foo will be deployed at \https://staging-118842.payara.app/foo.

Apps within the same namespace can interact using the URL format \http://deployedAppName/contextRoot/someEndpoint.

== Custom Domain Linking

You can link xref:user-guides/common/How to Use Custom Domains.adoc[custom domains] to a namespace. For example, myApp.foocompany.com can point to \https://staging-118842.payara.app. Once linked, foo app becomes accessible at \https://myApp.foocompany.com/foo.

== Context Root Definition

By default, the app's context root is either the application name or a path specified in glassfish-web.xml.
Apps can also designate a sub-path for external exposure, like app-context-root/public, keeping other paths like app-context-root/api internal.

== Setting up Communication Between Applications

Assume `bar` and `bazz` are deployed to the same namespace on {productName}, with `bar` exposing a REST endpoint api/finance that `bazz` consumes. The following sections illustrate their communication setup.

=== Deploying `bar` and `bazz`

Deploy both apps to a namespace, say \https://staging-118842.payara.app, making them accessible at \https://staging-118842.payara.app/`bar` and \https://staging-118842.payara.app/`bazz`.

If a custom domain `foocompany.com` is configured, the apps are available at \https://foocompany.com/bar and \https://foocompany.com/bazz respectively.

=== Accessing Endpoint in `bazz`

`bazz` can access `bars` /api/finance endpoint at the internal address http://`bar`/`bar`/api/finance.
This address uses the app name and context root for in-namespace routing.

Below is a code snippet demonstrating a call from `bar` to `bazz`'s api/finance endpoint:



[source,java]
----
public class FinanceApiClient {

    public  void doSomeFinance() {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create("http://bar/bar/api/finance"))
                .GET()
                .build();
            HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
            if (response.statusCode() == 200) {
               //Do custom work with the response
            }

    }
}
----

=== Use MicroProfile Config For Utmost Flexibility

Use MicroProfile Config properties to specify the endpoints, allowing different server URLs during development and production.
With this setup, xref:user-guides/common/application/Configure Application.adoc[app deployment configuration] on {productName} can override these properties.

Hereâ€™s how the above snippet can be adapted to use MicroProfile Config properties:

[source,java]
----
public class FinanceApiClient {

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name="`bar`.finance.endpoint")
    String resourceUrl;

    public  void doSomeFinance() {
        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create(resourceUrl))
                .GET()
                .build();
            HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
            if (response.statusCode() == 200) {
               //Do custom work with the response
            }

    }
}
----

With this setup, different URLs can be passed dynamically without redeploying the app. Modify this property anytime on the {productName} dashboard to suit your needs.

== External Communication
All deployed apps can make outbound communication to the wider internet, for example upload files to S3 storage, access database etc.

=== Port Requirements
{productName} does not support the exposure of specific ports.
This is a limitation of the underlying cloud providers.
If you need the services of such ports (for example port 25 for SMTP), we recommend the use of relay services on a different port such as 587.
