= {productName} Azure Customer Managed Region

The {productName} Azure Customer Managed Region feature allows you to deploy your applications to a dedicated, private cloud region within your own Azure account, providing more control and isolation compared to a shared cloud environment.

In essence, this service enables you to use the managed Jakarta EE capabilities of {productName} while maintaining your applications within your own Azure infrastructure.

== Setting Up Your {productName} Customer Managed Region on Azure

This guide will walk you through deploying a {productName} Customer Managed Region on Azure, allowing you to run your Jakarta EE applications in a dedicated, private cloud environment.

=== Prerequisites

* Public DNS Domain: You'll need a domain you control to create a subdomain for your {productName} region.
* Azure Subscription: You must have an active Azure subscription to deploy the managed application.


=== Step-by-Step Setup

==== Sign Up for {productName}

. Go to the {productName} signup page.
. Create an account using your preferred method (username/password, GitHub, or Google).

If you already have a {productName} account, login instead.

==== Create a Customer Managed Region

. In {productName}, select Switch Subscriptions menu.
. Select Private Cloud menu under the Switch Subscription menu

==== Deploy the Managed Application on Azure

. In the Azure portal, under My Market Place, click on plans and search for and select the "{productName} Customer Managed Region" managed application.

. Provide the following required parameters:
*** {productName} Connection String: Paste the connection string you copied earlier.
*** Domain to Create: Enter the subdomain you want to use (e.g., 'payara.yourdomain.com').
*** Let's Encrypt Email: Provide an email associated with your Let's Encrypt certificates.
. Deploy the managed application.

==== Configure DNS

. Once the deployment is complete, note the dns_nameservers output from the application.
. In your DNS provider's settings for your main domain, create an NS record pointing your subdomain (e.g., 'payara') to the provided nameservers.

==== Verify and Deploy Applications

. Back in {productName}, go to "Subscription Management" and ensure your new region is "Active."
. Navigate to "Application Management" and create a new namespace, selecting your custom region.
. xref:user-guides/common/application/Deploying an Application.adoc[Upload] your Jakarta EE web application (WAR file).
. Select "Deploy Immediately" and click "Upload."
. Once deployed, you can access your application using the provided URL.

=== Important Notes

If you encounter a certificate error, it might be because the Let's Encrypt certificate hasn't been issued yet.
Make sure your DNS settings are correct, and wait a few minutes.
You can monitor application logs within the {productName} interface.
