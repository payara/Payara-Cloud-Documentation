== Azul Platform Prime

Payara's partnership with Azul brings Azul Platform Prime to your application deployment.
Azul Platform Prime is a high-performance Java platform that delivers up to 37% faster performance compared to other OpenJDK distributions.
At its core is Azul Zing, an enhanced build of OpenJDK that serves as the actual JDK running your applications.
The platform requires no code changes or recompilation, making integration straightforward for existing Java applications.

Key advantages include:

* *Performance Improvements*: Azul Zing, the enhanced JDK that runs your applications, achieves improved responsiveness and consistency while maintaining performance SLAs, even as loads increase. It provides superior application performance, responsiveness, and efficiency compared to standard OpenJDK distributions.
* *Cost Reduction*: Organizations can reduce cloud compute costs by 20% or more through Azul Zing's more efficient CPU utilization and faster Java code execution, requiring fewer compute resources for the same workload.
* *Advanced Garbage Collection*: Azul Zing includes the C4 Pauseless Garbage Collector, which ensures consistent performance under heavy loads and enables 2-5X more transaction processing without pauses, eliminating the "stop-the-world" pauses that limit scalability in traditional JVMs.
* *Rapid Application Startup*: Azul Zing's ReadyNow technology speeds up application startup and time to peak performance by reusing profiling data, solving traditional Java warm-up issues and allowing applications to start fast and stay fast.
* *Optimizer Hub*: This optional Azul Platform Prime component provides centralized JIT compilation and intelligent curation of optimization profiles, enabling fleet-wide collaboration where multiple Azul Zing JVMs share optimizations and learnings for improved cloud scale, elasticity, and cost efficiencies.
