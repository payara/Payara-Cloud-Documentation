[[create-a-namespace]]
== Creating a Namespace
A Namespace in {productName} works as a container that organizes your applications within your subscription.

Each namespace:

* Creates a dedicated environment for managing related applications
* Has its own domain name
* Allows applications to be deployed at specific paths under that domain

=== How to Create a Namespace
.Namespace creation dialog
image::image6.png[Creating a new namespace,width=504,height=435]

. Click the btn:[Create New Namespace] button from the application management dashboard
. Fill in these required fields:
* *Project*: Enter a name (using only letters, numbers, and dashes). This becomes part of your application's URL.
* *Stage*: Specify your environment (like "qa", "test", or "production")
* *Cloud Region*: Select your preferred cloud provider and location for hosting:
** AWS (EU Central 1 or US East 2)
** Azure (West Europe or East US)
. Click btn:[Create Namespace]

After creation, you'll be taken to the namespace details screen where you can start adding applications.

[[upload-an-application]]
== Uploading an Application

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
Uploading an application is straightforward. From the *Namespace Details Screen*, click btn:[Upload Application].

Choose the appropriate file type for your application:

* *Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications*: Upload a WAR file
* *Spring Boot applications*: Upload a JAR file

endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
Uploading an application is straightforward. From the *Namespace Details Screen*, click btn:[Upload Application].

Upload your Jakarta EE/MicroProfile application as a WAR file.

.Namespace home screen
image::image8.png[Uploading an application,width=624,height=257,link="{imagesdir}/image8.png", window="_blank"]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
A dialog box will appear, prompting you to choose the WAR or JAR file for deployment.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
A dialog box will appear, prompting you to choose the WAR file for deployment.
endif::[]

If your application doesn't require any special configuration, simply mark the *Deploy Immediately* checkbox.

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
The application name is important as it also serves as the DNS name for the container hosting your application.
This name is either specified in the {productName} Console dialog, derived from the `artifactId` in the `pom.xml` file if your application file is Maven-built, or taken from the uploaded file name.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]

.Application upload dialog
image::image9.png[Application details post-upload,width=624,height=370]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
Once the application file is uploaded, you'll be navigated to the application's detail screen for configuration before deploying it.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
Once the WAR file is uploaded, you'll be navigated to the application's detail screen for configuration before deploying it.

[[review-configuration]]
== Reviewing Configuration

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
Configurations in {productName} cover different areas depending on your application type:

*For Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications:*

* MicroProfile Config properties
* Context root
* Database connections for JPA data sources

*For Spring Boot applications:*

* Application properties
* Profile-specific configurations

If your Jakarta EE/MicroProfile application uses the MicroProfile Config API and has the microprofile-config.properties file, all properties declared in that file will be available in the {productName} Console.

If your Jakarta EE/MicroProfile application bundles a persistence.xml file, then the datasource definition as declared through @Datasource annotation or in the web.xml will also be available for editing.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
Configurations in {productName} cover three main areas: MicroProfile Config properties, context root, and database connections for JPA data sources.

If your application uses the MicroProfile Config API and has the microprofile-config.properties file, all properties declared in that file will be available in the {productName} Console.

If your application bundles a persistence.xml file, then the datasource definition as declared through @Datasource annotation or in the web.xml will also be available for editing.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
=== Runtime Type for Jakarta EE Applications

For Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications, choose a runtime type based on your application's Jakarta EE, Payara, and JDK versions. The table below summarizes the supported versions:

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Jakarta EE Version | Payara Version | JDK
|  8 |  5 |  11 /17/ 21
|  10 |  6 |  11 /17/ 21
|===

As an example, if your application is developed on Jakarta EE 8 and compiled for JDK 17, then you can pick the option for Jakarta EE 8 (Payara 5, JDK17).

And if your application is developed with Jakarta EE 10 and compiled for JDK 21, then you should select Jakarta EE 10 (Payara6, JDK 21) option

NOTE: {productName} by default will assign a runtime based on referenced Jakarta EE classes and target JDK version for the compiled classes.

.Runtime Types

image::image-37-runtime-type2.png[Choosing a runtime type, link="{imagesdir}/image-37-runtime-type2.png", window="_blank"]
