= Application Configuration

{productName} supports MicroProfile Config, Spring Boot and Quarkus configuration properties, providing an intuitive dashboard for managing all aspects of your application configuration.

For Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications, configuration properties are managed through MicroProfile Config using the `microprofile-config.properties` file.

For Spring Boot applications, configuration properties are managed using Spring Boot's standard `application.properties` file.

For Quarkus applications, configuration properties are managed using Quarkus's standard `application.properties` file.

== Accessing Application Configuration

Click on the btn:[Application Actions] button to access all actions related to the application.

The unconfigured status means that the platform detected that a configuration is required before you can deploy your application. The Deploy action is also not available when the status is unconfigured. When the application uses a database (found a persistence.xml file, not when using @DataSourceDefinition) the status is automatically unconfigured until the configuration is made.

To configure your application for deployment, click Change Configuration.

== Configuration Overview

The configuration screen allows you to set up your application before deployment. {productName} supports configuration for:

* **Configuration Properties** - Application-specific settings
* **Context Root** - The URL path where your application is accessible
* **Database Configuration** - Connection settings for data sources

The configuration options available depend on your application type:

* **Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications**: Configuration properties from `microprofile-config.properties` and database settings from `persistence.xml`
* **Spring Boot applications**: Configuration properties from `application.properties` and Spring datasource configuration
* **Quarkus applications**: Configuration properties from `application.properties` and Quarkus datasource configuration

=== Deployment Configuration

Before deploying your application, you'll need to configure:

**Runtime Type** - Select the appropriate runtime for your application:

* For Jakarta EE 8 applications, select btn:[Payara 5, JDK 11]
* For Jakarta EE 10 applications, select btn:[Payara 6, JDK 21]
* For Spring Boot applications, select the appropriate Spring Boot runtime option
* For Quarkus applications, select the appropriate Quarkus runtime option

**Runtime Size** - Select the amount of resources to allocate for this instance from the drop-down box. The resources count against the included CPU of your subscription.

**Database Connection** (if applicable) - If your application connects to a datasource, you'll need to provide:

* JDBC URL
* Datasource class name
* Username and password for database authentication

== Configuration Properties

You can add, update and remove configuration properties for your application on the configuration panel of the application dashboard.
The specific configuration mechanism used depends on your application type:

* **Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications**: Use MicroProfile Config properties
* **Spring Boot applications**: Use Spring Boot configuration properties
* **Quarkus applications**: Use Quarkus configuration properties

[checklist]
* ❶ Restrict Fields: This option allows you to mark fields as restricted for confidentiality. Values of restricted fields will be represented as * characters
* ❷ Add Config Property: Clicking this button opens up the form to add a new configuration property for your application

=== Automatic Sensitive Field Detection

During the application upload process, {productName} performs a best-effort automatic detection and pre-restriction of configuration properties that may contain sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, tokens, and other credentials.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This automatic detection is a best-effort process and may not identify all possible sensitive fields in your configuration. Users should review their configuration properties and manually restrict any additional sensitive fields as needed using the field restriction features described below.
====

=== Adding Configuration Properties

For Jakarta EE/MicroProfile, Spring Boot, and Quarkus applications, you can create new properties by clicking the btn:[Add Configuration Key].

Configuration properties provide a way to externalize configuration parameters for your application:

* **Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications**: Use MicroProfile Config properties from `microprofile-config.properties`. You can inject them using CDI (@ConfigProperty) or retrieve them programmatically.
* **Spring Boot applications**: Use Spring Boot configuration properties from `application.properties` or `application.yml`. These can be injected using @Value or @ConfigurationProperties.
* **Quarkus applications**: Use application properties from `application.properties`. You can inject them using @ConfigProperty or access them programmatically.

When you upload your application, {productName} looks for the appropriate configuration file (`microprofile-config.properties` for Jakarta EE/MicroProfile, or `application.properties` for Spring Boot and Quarkus) to read existing configuration parameters.
Your default parameters are read and displayed here, and you can override them or add new configuration keys.
The Add Configuration Key is useful when reading configuration values programmatically or when the values don't have a default in your configuration files.

.Add Configuration Key
image::how-to-guides/application/application-19-add-config-key.png[window="_blank", link="{imagesdir}/how-to-guides/application/application-19-add-config-key.png"]

[NOTE]
====
Configuration properties added through the {productName} Console are made available to your application at runtime, but they will NOT modify or be written back to your application's `.properties` files.
This ensures that your application's source configuration files remain unchanged while still allowing you to override or add configuration values through the platform interface.
====

=== Common Quarkus Properties

[IMPORTANT]
====
Quarkus distinguishes between different configuration phases that affect when properties can be changed:

* **Build-time properties**: These properties are locked in when the application is built using Maven or Gradle. They configure aspects like which extensions are enabled, what features are compiled in, and how the application is optimized. Examples include `quarkus.datasource.db-kind`, `quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation`, and properties prefixed with `quarkus.index.*`. These properties *cannot* be changed through the {productName} Console during deployment, as the application is not rebuilt at this stage. To modify build-time properties, you must rebuild your application with the desired configuration before deploying.

* **Runtime properties**: These properties can be changed at application startup and can be overridden through the {productName} Console. Examples include connection URLs (`quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url`), credentials (`quarkus.datasource.username`, `quarkus.datasource.password`), logging levels (`quarkus.log.level`), and HTTP port configuration (`quarkus.http.port`).

* **Build-time with runtime overrides**: Some properties are read at build time but can be overridden at runtime. These are typically configuration values that affect generated code but have sensible runtime override capabilities.

To determine which configuration phase a property belongs to, consult the https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config[Quarkus Configuration Reference]. Properties marked with a lock icon or labeled as "build time" cannot be changed after the application is built.

Note that some Quarkus properties may be overridden by the platform to ensure proper operation and integration with {productName} infrastructure.
====

Quarkus applications typically use properties such as:

[source,properties]
----
# Application configuration
quarkus.application.name=my-quarkus-app
quarkus.http.port=8080

# Database configuration (runtime properties only)
quarkus.datasource.username=myuser
quarkus.datasource.password=mypassword
quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb

# Logging configuration
quarkus.log.level=INFO
quarkus.log.category."com.example".level=DEBUG
----

These runtime properties can be configured through the {productName} Console when deploying your Quarkus application. Changes to runtime properties require redeployment to take effect. Remember that build-time properties cannot be changed through the Console and require rebuilding your application.

=== Common Spring Boot Properties

[NOTE]
====
Spring Boot does not have explicit build-time vs runtime property types like Quarkus. All Spring Boot configuration properties are read when the application starts. However, properties that initialize infrastructure resources (such as datasources, server ports, or connection pools) require the application to restart for changes to take effect.

Properties configured through the {productName} Console override values in your `application.properties` file at startup. Note that some properties listed in the "Spring Boot Property Limitations" section below are platform-managed and will be overridden by {productName} regardless of values set in the Console.
====

Spring Boot applications typically use properties such as:

[source,properties]
----
# Application configuration (note: server.port and spring.application.name are platform-managed)
spring.profiles.active=production

# Database configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=mypassword

# Logging configuration
logging.level.com.example=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.web=INFO
----

These properties can be configured through the {productName} Console when deploying your Spring Boot application. Changes to these properties require redeployment to take effect.

=== Spring Boot Property Limitations

For Spring Boot applications, while you can modify certain properties through the {productName} Console, any changes to the following system-managed properties will be ignored at runtime.
{productName} hardcodes these values to ensure proper operation and log collection for the Spring application instance:

[source,properties]
----
# Server configuration
server.forward-headers-strategy=NATIVE
server.port=8080
server.servlet.context-path=[auto-determined]
spring.application.name=[auto-determined]

# Management and monitoring
management.health.probes.enabled=true
management.endpoint.prometheus.enabled=true
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus,metrics,health
----

=== Restricting Fields

You can restrict configuration properties (MicroProfile Config, Spring Boot, and Quarkus properties) by clicking the Restricted Fields link on the configuration panel.

Clicking that button brings up the restrict fields option as shown below.

.Restrict fields option
image::how-to-guides/application/application-15-restrict-fields.png[window="_blank", link="{imagesdir}/how-to-guides/application/application-15-restrict-fields.png"]

You can select any number of fields to set as restricted. Clicking save, the restricted fields will be rendered as follows.

.Restricted config fields
image::how-to-guides/application/application-16-restrected-fields.png[window="_blank", link="{imagesdir}/how-to-guides/application/application-16-restrected-fields.png"]

[[context-root]]
== Context Root

For Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications, the name of the WAR file is taken as the context root by default. For Spring Boot and Quarkus applications, the context root can be configured through application properties (`server.servlet.context-path` for Spring Boot, `quarkus.http.root-path` for Quarkus).

Using the Application Configuration screen, the context root value can be changed for all application types.

image::image15.png[Table Description automatically generated with medium confidence,width=624,height=221,window="_blank", link="{imagesdir}/image15.png"]

[[internet-accessible-paths]]
=== Internet-Accessible Paths

While everything served under a specified context root path is accessible to other applications within the namespace, it is possible to restrict which sub-paths of the context root are accessible over the internet. By default all paths are available `/*`

To set which sub-paths are accessible, enter space-separated patterns in the form of `/prefix*`. Sub-paths matching this prefix will be available through the domain name of the namespace, while other paths will only be accessible to other applications within the same namespace.

For example, let's assume Context Root of `/orders` and Internet-Accessible Paths `/details/*` `/cancel/*`.

Then requests like

\https://namespace-domain.payara.app/orders/details/000234

or

\https://namespace-domain.payara.app/orders/cancel/00234

are directed to application.

Requests to \https://namespace-domain.payara.app/orders/place will be handled by the application handling the root namespace.

Other applications within this namespace can reach the handler for `/place` of this application by accessing \http://applicationName/orders/place.

Note that communications within a namespace are http only, as the traffic is limited to the namespace. HTTPS is available for inbound traffic into the namespace.

[[database-configuration]]
== Database Configuration

When you upload your application, {productName} detects database configuration requirements:

* **Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications**: Looks for the `persistence.xml` file. If detected, you can specify database source configuration parameters for the referenced JNDI name.
* **Spring Boot applications**: Detects Spring Boot data source configuration properties (e.g., `spring.datasource.*` properties). You can configure database connection parameters through the application properties interface.
* **Quarkus applications**: Detects Quarkus data source configuration properties (e.g., `quarkus.datasource.*` properties). You can configure database connection parameters through the application properties interface.

=== Alternative Database Configuration Methods

==== Jakarta EE/MicroProfile: Databases without JPA

If you are using plain JDBC connections instead of the JPA functionality of Jakarta EE, you can make use of the @DataSourceDefinition:

[source,java]
----
@DataSourceDefinition(name="java:global/jdbc/cloud-postgres",
        className="org.postgresql.ds.PGSimpleDataSource",
        serverName = "${MPCONFIG=ds_servername}",
        portNumber = 5432,
        databaseName = "${MPCONFIG=ds_databasename}",
        user="${MPCONFIG=ds_username}",
        password="${MPCONFIG=ds_password}"
)
----

Or define the <data-source> element in _web.xml_:

[source,xml]
----
<data-source>
    <name>java:global/jdbc/cloud-mysql</name>
    <class-name>com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource</class-name>
    <server-name>${MPCONFIG=ds_servername}</server-name>
    <port-number>3306</port-number>
    <database-name>${MPCONFIG=ds_databasename}</database-name>
    <user>${MPCONFIG=ds_username}</user>
    <password>${MPCONFIG=ds_password}</password>
</data-source>
----

combined with `MPCONFIG` MicroProfile Config variables. These variables can be configured in the {productName} Console.

If you are using plain JDBC connections instead of the JPA functionality of Jakarta EE, you need to define the MicroProfile configuration keys manually in {productName} so the system can detect them as described above. Click 'Add Configuration Key' and enter the property value.  In both cases, make sure the appropriate database driver is included in the WAR file you deploy.

==== Spring Boot: Database Configuration

For Spring Boot applications, database configuration is typically done through standard Spring Boot properties:

[source,properties]
----
# PostgreSQL example
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=mypassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

# MySQL example
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=myuser
spring.datasource.password=mypassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
----

These properties can be configured through the {productName} application properties interface, allowing you to set database connection parameters without modifying your application code. Make sure the appropriate database driver dependency is included in your Spring Boot application.

[[allowing-access-to-your-database-from-payara-cloud]]
=== *Allowing Access to your Database from {productName}*

If you'd like to provision a database for the best possible performance, it is recommended to provision it on Microsoft Azure in the same region as the namespace.

If your database access is restricted by IP address, enable access to the following IP addresses based on the region the namespace is located in:

|===
| Region | IP Address(es)

| Azure, West Europe
| 20.101.201.13

| Azure, East US
| 40.76.131.181
|===

When you are happy with your configuration settings, click Save to return to the application details screen.
