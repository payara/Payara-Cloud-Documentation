= Limitations of Cloud Runtime

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
{productName} is a deployment runtime that supports both Jakarta EE and Spring Boot applications.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
{productName} is a Jakarta EE focused deployment runtime that automatically provisions a Payara Micro instance for your applications.
endif::[]

As a cloud deployment runtime, {productName} has the following limitations.

== Standalone Service
ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
{productName} focuses exclusively on running your applications (Jakarta EE and Spring Boot).
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
{productName} focuses exclusively on running your Jakarta EE applications.
endif::[]

You'll need to source and integrate other essential services, such as databases or message queues, from external providers.
{productName} allows full outbound connectivity for implementing such services.

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
== Framework Support
{productName} supports both Jakarta EE and Spring Boot applications.
If your project relies on other Java frameworks like Quarkus or Micronaut, you'll need to consider alternative deployment solutions.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
== Jakarta EE Specific
{productName} is specifically tailored for Jakarta EE applications.
If your project relies on other Java frameworks like Spring, Quarkus, or Micronaut, you'll need to consider alternative deployment solutions.
endif::[]


== File System Access

No writing outside  /tmp.
No reading outside of current working dir (/opt/payara).

== Storage
Local storage is limited to 1GB, inclusive of the size of your WAR file.


== Network Access

Requests to the same namespace and the external network are allowed.
Other internal requests are blocked.

== Java Version
{productName} supports Java 11, 17 and 21.
{productName} only supports LTS Java versions.
Older Java versions are not supported.


== Runtime Stability
Applications may be restarted due to node reallocation (immediate SIGTERM for Singletons, 60-second grace period for horizontal scaling, rolling upgrade via SIGTERM).
Please refer to the xref:user-guides/common/application/app-runtime.adoc[scalability doc] for more details about terminations.

== Limited Customization
While {productName} simplifies deployment, it offers less granular control compared to self-managing Payara Server instances on virtual machines or containers.
You may have fewer options to fine-tune the runtime environment or install specific extensions.

== Evolving Features
{productName} is under active development.
This means features and supported technologies are subject to change.
Make sure to stay updated on {productName}'s roadmap and release notes.

=== Important Considerations

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
==== Before choosing {productName}, carefully weigh these limitations:

. Project Nature: Is your project built on Jakarta EE or Spring Boot standards?
. Customization Needs: How much control do you require over the runtime environment?
. Integrations: What external services does your application rely on, and how easily can they be integrated with {productName}?
. Budget: Does {productName}'s pricing align with your project's financial constraints?
