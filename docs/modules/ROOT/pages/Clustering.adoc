- Application can be scaled by three options
 * *Rollover upgrade:* With this option, new version of application is deployed and old one is terminated after new version reports ready state
 * *Singleton:* At most one instance of application is running. Old revision is terminated before deployment of new one starts
 * *Horizontal scaling:* Deploy multiple instances of an application

== Following options are common for all three scaling types

- Runtime size: The runtime size specifies the amount of resources to allocate for this instance and count against the included vCPU of your subscription. The resource allocation is as follows:

- Runtime type: Runtime environment for the deployed application

    - Rollover time:
        * *Moderate:* Add 90 second timeout before shutdown sequence is initiated
        * *Minimal:* The instance immediately shuts down as soon as new instance reached ready state


== Following options can be select for Horizontal scaling

 - Number of Replicas: The number of replicas to be created for the application. Values can be set from 2 to 8

 Modify scaling option

  - when application is running on Horizontal scaling mode, application home page will display "Adjust scale" button

  -  "Adjust scale" will display dialog where number of instance can be defined. Click Apply to save changes
