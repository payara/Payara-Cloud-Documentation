* Describe any error messages received
* Mention any workarounds attempted
* Note the urgency/severity of the issue

== Response Times and Limitations

* This is a Beta feature. The Feature and user experience is largely complete, tested and stable.
AWS Region has configuration and dependencies that are unlikely to change.
There is a low risk of data loss.
The feature is supported on a commercially-reasonable effort basis, but with the expectation that issues require extra time and assistance from development to troubleshoot.
* Critical issues affecting service availability receive priority attention
* General feedback and feature requests are reviewed periodically
* You may be contacted for additional information if needed
