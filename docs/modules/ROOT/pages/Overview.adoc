== What is Payara Qube?

Payara Qube is an enterprise-grade platform for deploying Jakarta EE, Spring Boot, and Quarkus applications.
It simplifies deployment by automating infrastructure provisioning and removing the need to manually manage application servers, containers, and Kubernetes clusters.
Instead of dealing with low-level components, the Payara Qube Console lets you configure your application and its runtime through a simple, guided UI and CLI for automated environments.

== Consumption Models

Payara Qube is available in two consumption models:

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
* **Payara Qube (Managed)**: A fully managed service where Payara hosts and operates the platform infrastructure. Your team can focus entirely on application development without operating the underlying infrastructure.
* **Payara Qube**: A self-hosted platform that you install and run on your own Kubernetes infrastructure, giving you complete control over your environment, data, and security.

This documentation covers **Payara Qube (Managed)**, the fully managed service.
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
* **Payara Qube**: A self-hosted platform that you install and run on your own Kubernetes infrastructure, giving you complete control over your environment, data, and security. Ideal for organizations with strict compliance requirements, data residency needs, or existing infrastructure investments.
* **Payara Qube (Managed)**: A fully managed service where Payara hosts and operates the platform infrastructure.

This documentation covers **Payara Qube**, the self-hosted platform.

== Architecture

{productName} is built on a cloud-native architecture that runs on Kubernetes infrastructure.
ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
By design, {productName} handles background tasks you don't need to worry about.
endif::[]
ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
The platform runs entirely within your own Kubernetes clusters, making it ideal for organizations with strict compliance requirements, data residency needs, or existing infrastructure investments.

Behind the scenes, a Payara Micro instance is set up to run your application.
Integrations are automatic, including SSL/TLS certificates, routing, logging, and monitoring.
The {productName} environment centers on two concepts: namespaces and applications.

A namespace groups applications under a single domain, each with its own path prefix.
Manage namespaces and applications in the {productName} Console through both a graphical user interface and comprehensive APIs for automation.

== Supported Application Types

{productName} supports three major application frameworks:

* **Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications**: Deployed as WAR files, supporting Jakarta EE 8 (Payara 5) and Jakarta EE 10 (Payara 6)
* **Spring Boot applications**: Deployed as JAR files with full Spring Boot configuration support
* **Quarkus applications**: Deployed as ZIP files with native Quarkus configuration support
