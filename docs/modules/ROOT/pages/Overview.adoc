ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
{productName} is a fully hosted platform for automatically deploying Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) and MicroProfile applications.
It delivers the Payara Qube experience as a managed service, so your team consumes the platform without operating the underlying infrastructure.
It simplifies cloud deployment by automating infrastructure provisioning and removing the need to manually manage application servers, containers, and Kubernetes clusters.
Instead of dealing with low-level components like Kubernetes and cloud monitoring tools, the {productName} Console lets you configure your application and its runtime through a simple, guided UI.
If you're new to {productName}, start with the *Getting Started* section.

== Structure

By design, {productName} handles background tasks you don't need to worry about.
Behind the scenes, a Payara Micro instance is set up to run your application.
Cloud integrations are automatic, including SSL/TLS certificates, routing, logging, and monitoring.
Because applications run on Payara Micro, {productName} supports Jakarta EE Web Profile applications.
The {productName} environment centers on two concepts: namespaces and applications.

A namespace groups applications under a single domain, each with its own path prefix.
Manage namespaces and applications in the {productName} Console.

Payara Qube is a self-hosted application platform that brings the power of Payara's enterprise Java deployment runtime to your own infrastructure.
It provides enterprise-grade application deployment capabilities while giving you complete control over your environment, data, and security.
Unlike managed cloud solutions, Payara Qube runs entirely within your own Kubernetes clusters, making it ideal for organizations with strict compliance requirements, data residency needs, or existing infrastructure investments.
If you're new to Payara Qube, we recommend starting with the *Getting Started* section to understand installation and initial configuration.

== Architecture

Payara Qube is built on a cloud-native architecture that runs on your Kubernetes infrastructure.
The platform consists of a control plane for management and orchestration, plus runtime environments where your Jakarta EE applications execute.

Your applications run on Payara Micro instances within containerized environments, with full integration for monitoring, logging, and scaling capabilities.
Unlike cloud PaaS solutions, you maintain complete control over the underlying infrastructure, networking, and security policies.
The Payara Qube environment is centered around namespaces and applications, similar to cloud platforms, but with additional controls for resource management, security policies, and infrastructure configuration.
You manage your environment through both a graphical user interface and comprehensive APIs for automation and integration with your existing DevOps workflows.

== Features

* Complete infrastructure control
* Jakarta EE 10/Spring/Quarkus compatibility
* Built-in scalability
* Built-in monitoring and logging
* Custom domain support
* SSL/TLS certificate management
