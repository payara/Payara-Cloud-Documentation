= Subscription and Billing Management

In Payara Cloud, a subscription serves as the fundamental billing unit, encompassing the resources and access levels you've selected for your cloud deployment needs.
It acts as the focal point for billing, consolidating all application usage across various namespaces into a single, easy-to-understand invoice.
The subscription model simplifies the billing process, providing a clear and aggregated view of your Payara Cloud usage and costs.
