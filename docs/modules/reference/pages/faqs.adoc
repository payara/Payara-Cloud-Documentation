Is there downtime when I upgrade my application?::

{productName} minimizes downtime during upgrades by keeping the current version running until the new one is fully deployed and ready.
There might be a negligible downtime during the switchover, but all uploaded and undeployed application versions remain available for easy rollback.

How do I pick the appropriate runtime size for my application?::

The runtime size determines the resource allocation for your application instance.
You should choose a size based on your application's resource requirements, considering factors like memory usage and CPU utilization.
{productName} offers different runtime sizes (Small, Medium, Large, XL) with varying resource allocations.

What is a namespace?::

A namespace in {productName} is a container for grouping and isolating resources.
A subscription can have multiple namespaces, and each namespace can host multiple applications.
Each deployed application within a namespace is accessible as a context path on the namespace's domain.

I just created a namespace and deployed an app, but itâ€™s showing as 404, what gives?::

This is expected behavior.
When you create a namespace and deploy an app for the first time, the full URL to the app needs time to propagate across the DNS system.
This usually takes between 5 and 20 minutes. In rare occasions, this can take up to 24 hours.

I have uploaded a new app version, what next?::

After successfully uploading a new app version, its status will show as "configured" on the dashboard.
You can then either configure it further or deploy it using the available options.

Why is the previous version of my application showing as (Deployed)?::

The previous versions of your app will be undeployed once a new version is deployed. The status "(Deployed)" indicates that they are not the currently active, deployed version.
