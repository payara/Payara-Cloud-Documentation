I just created a namespace and deployed an app, but it's showing as 404, what gives?::

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
This can happen for a few reasons:

* If you're using external DNS, the full URL to the app needs time to propagate across the DNS system, which usually takes between 5 and 20 minutes
* Check that your infrastructure's network configuration allows access to the application
* Verify that the application has started successfully in the monitoring dashboard
endif::[]

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "cloud"]
This is expected behavior.
When you create a namespace and deploy an app for the first time, the full URL to the app needs time to propagate across the DNS system.
This usually takes between 5 and 20 minutes. In rare occasions, this can take up to 24 hours.
endif::[]

I have uploaded a new app version, what next?::

After successfully uploading a new app version, its status will show as "configured" on the dashboard.
You can then either configure it further or deploy it using the available options.

Why is the previous version of my application showing as (Deployed)?::

The previous versions of your app will be undeployed once a new version is deployed. The status "(Deployed)" indicates that they are not the currently active, deployed version.
