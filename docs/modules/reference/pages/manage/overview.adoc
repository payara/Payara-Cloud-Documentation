= Application Management

Application Management within Payara Cloud is your control center for managing applications. Here, you can configure, deploy, and group applications into namespaces.

== Concepts

In Payara Cloud, your subscription acts as a billing unit and allows you to create multiple namespaces.
A namespace is essentially a logical grouping of applications.

Although all applications within a subscription are deployed on a single Payara Cloud cluster, they remain isolated from each other.
These applications share a single domain but are distinguishable on the internet through unique sub-paths.

A namespace comprises two elements:

* Project - Defines the purpose of the applications
* Stage - Indicates the deployment phase of the project, such as "dev", "testing", or "production"


== Accessing Application Management

To access the Application Management area, click the btn:[Log In] button on the link:https://payara.cloud[Payara Cloud] homepage or visit https://manage.payara.cloud directly.

For a step-by-step login guide, see xref:billing/signup/login.adoc[].
