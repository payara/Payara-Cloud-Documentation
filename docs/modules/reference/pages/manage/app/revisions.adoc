= Application Revision

Payara Cloud uses revisions for application version management.
A revision represents an immutable snapshot of your uploaded application's binary at a particular point in time.
This allows for tracking changes and potential rollbacks.

.Application Revisions Details
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: Name of the application under review.
* ❷ Revisions Table: Lists all revisions of the application.
* ❸ Revision Number: Identifies the sequence number of each revision.
* ❹ Uploaded Date: Revision uploaded/created date.
* ❺ Configured Date: The date when the uploaded binary was configured.
* ❻ Deployed Date: The deployment date of the current revision.
* ❼ Revision Status: The current status of the revision.
* ❽ Actions: Menu for viewing, editing, or deploying revisions.


== Reverting To Prior Versions
Each revision maintains its unique xref:manage/app/configuration/microprofile-config.adoc[configurations], distinct from others.
Configurations applied to one revision do not affect others, enabling you to experiment with different versions of your application under various settings.
For instance, you might have one version of your application designed to connect to a Postgres database, while another connects to a MariaDB database.

You have the option to revert to any previous version using the "Revision Actions" menu available for each version.

[checklist]
* ❶ View Configuration: Click display the current settings for the application in a read-only format.
* ❷ Edit Configuration: Click to open the current configuration of the application in edit mode.
* ❸ Revert: Click to roll back to this particular revision.

Choosing to revert to an earlier version than the most recently deployed one will cause that version, along with its specific configurations, to be deployed.
This reverted revision then becomes the most current, active version of your application.

NOTE:  Only one revision can be actively deployed and running at any given time.
