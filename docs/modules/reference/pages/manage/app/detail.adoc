== Understanding Application States

Applications hosted on Payara Cloud can be in various states throughout their lifecycle.

[#_pending_state]
=== PENDING State
An application first enters the PENDING state when it is uploaded but not yet deployed.

.Details of PENDING State:
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: Displays the current application's name
* ❷ PENDING State: Shows that the application is ready for deployment
* ❸ Deployed Application URL: This field remains blank as the application is yet to be deployed
* ❹ Management Menu: Provides options to edit, deploy, upload a new .war file, access logs, and delete the application
* ❺ Duplicate Management Menu: Identical ❹
* ❻ Revision Table Menu: Offers options to view, edit, or deploy the application. The 'Deployed At' date is absent since the application hasn't been deployed

[#_running_state]
=== RUNNING State
An application is in the RUNNING state when it has been successfully deployed and is accessible online.

.Running application

.Details of RUNNING State
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: The current application's name
* ❷ RUNNING State: Indicates the application is active and deployed
* ❸ Application URL: The URL through which the deployed application is accessible

[#_stopped_state]
=== STOPPED State
A STOPPED application is one that was previously running but has been manually halted.

.Application in stopped state
image::manage/application/application-5-stopped-status.png[]

.Details of STOPPED State
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: The current application's name
* ❷ STOPPED State: Shows that the application is currently not active
* ❸ Application URL:  URL of the stopped application, which leads to a 502 error when accessed
* ❹ Deployed time stamp: Indicates the last deployment time of the application
* ❺ Start Application Button: Used to restart the application, transitioning it back to the RUNNING state





== Application Revisions: Managing and Tracking Changes
Over its lifetime, an application in Payara Cloud undergoes several revisions, each representing a unique binary upload.


.Application revisions table
image::manage/application/application-7-applicaiton-revisions.png[]

.Application Revisions Details
[checklist]
* ❶ Application Name: Name of the application under review
* ❷ Revisions Table: Lists all revisions of the application
* ❸ Revision Number: Identifies the sequence number of each revision
* ❹ Uploaded Date: Revision uploaded/created date
* ❺ Configured Date: The date when the uploaded binary was configured
* ❻ Deployed Date: The deployment date of the current revision
* ❼ Revision Status: The current status of the revision
* ❽ Actions: Menu for viewing, editing, or deploying revisions

The revisions table is a critical tool for managing your application.
It allows to roll back to previous versions as needed. It provides history of the binary artifact's status at the time of each upload
This feature ensures flexibility in version control and deployment strategies.




== Starting, Stopping, and Scaling Applications: A Guide

You can start an application in a <<_stopped_state>> by using any of the available options.

.Options to start a stopped application

[checklist]
* ❶ Application Actions Menu: Start an application from the application action menu
* ❷ Start Application Button: To start the application

Starting a stopped application through any of the above options transitions the application back to the <<_running_state>>
