= Applications

Payara Cloud organizes applications within distinct Namespaces.
Follow these steps to interact with your applications:

*Locate the Namespace*: First, identify the Namespace where your application is deployed.
This can be done by navigating to the Namespace list section.

*View Applications*: Each Namespace represents a list of its associated applications.

[checklist]
* ❶ Namespace name in which application is deployed
* ❷ Base URL of the Namespace
* ❸ Table of applications in the Namespace
* ❹ Application name
* ❺ Application status. An application can have PENDING, CONFIGURED or DEPLOYED status at any point in time
* ❻ Internet accessible URL of the deployed application
* ❼ Button to create and upload new application to this Namespace

The Applications table provides a comprehensive overview of all applications within the current Namespace.
To open a specific application, click on its name.
This action will direct you to the xref:manage/app/detail.adoc[application detail page].
Additionally, you can access a deployed application directly by clicking on its "Live URL."
