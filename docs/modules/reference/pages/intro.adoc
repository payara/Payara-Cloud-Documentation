= Introduction to Payara Cloud

Payara Cloud is a cloud-based (Payara-Server as a Service) platform that simplifies the deployment and management of Jakarta EE and MicroProfile web applications in the cloud.
It eliminates the need for manual setup and configuration of servers and infrastructure, allowing you to focus on building and delivering your applications faster.

== Key Features:
* *Automatic Deployment and Scaling*: Payara Cloud automates the deployment process through a user-friendly UI. It also provides automatic scaling capabilities, adjusting resources based on demand to ensure optimal performance and cost-efficiency.
* *High Availability*: The platform guarantees high availability by distributing application instances across multiple availability zones. This built-in redundancy minimizes downtime and ensures your applications remain accessible in the unlikely event of infrastructure failures.
* *Monitoring and Metrics*: Payara Cloud offers comprehensive monitoring and metrics dashboards, providing real-time insights into the health and performance of your applications. This enables proactive issue identification and resolution.
* *Security*: Payara Cloud incorporates features like network isolation, encryption, secure access controls, and automated security updates to safeguard your applications and data.
* *Centralized Logging*: Payara Cloud centralizes application logs, making it easy to search, filter, and analyze log data for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
* *Smooth Integrations*: Payara Cloud integrates with other cloud services, such as databases, storage, and messaging queues, allowing you to take advantage of the full power of the cloud ecosystem.
* *User-Friendly UI*: Payara Cloud provides an intuitive web-based management console for easy application deployment, configuration, and monitoring.

== Conceptual Framework

Payara Cloud's conceptual framework revolves around the following key elements:

* *Namespace*: A logical grouping of related applications within a Payara Cloud subscription. Namespaces provide isolation, organization, and a unique domain for deploying applications.
* *Custom Domains*: The ability to link custom domain names to namespaces, improving the professionalism and user-friendliness of your deployed applications.
* *Application*: The individual deployable unit within a namespace. Applications are typically packaged as WAR files and represent the core functionality of your project.
* *Subscription*: The billing unit in Payara Cloud, defining the resources and access levels available to users.
* *Access Management*: A role-based access control system that governs user permissions and ensures secure and controlled access to the platform.

Payara Cloud's architecture uses containerization and orchestration technologies to deploy, manage, and scale Jakarta EE and MicroProfile web applications in the cloud.
It supports various deployment scenarios, including rolling upgrades, singleton instances, and horizontal scaling, providing flexibility to meet the specific needs of your applications.

Using a user-friendly interface, powerful features, and an industry standard underlying architecture, Payara Cloud simplifies the complexities of cloud-native Jakarta EE and MicroProfile web application deployment and management, accelerating your time to market
