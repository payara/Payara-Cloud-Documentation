= Introduction to Payara Cloud

Payara Cloud is a cloud-based (Payara-Server as a Service) platform that simplifies the deployment and management of Jakarta EE and MicroProfile web applications.
It eliminates the need for manual setup and configuration of servers and infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building and delivering their applications.

== Key Features:
* Automatic deployment and scaling
* High availability
* Monitoring and metrics
* Security
* Centralized logging
* Straightforward integration with other cloud services
* User-friendly web interface

== Conceptual Framework

Payara Cloud uses the concepts of namespaces and applications.

* A namespace is a logical grouping of related applications, providing isolation and organization.
* Applications are the individual deployable units within a namespace.
* Subscriptions define the resources and access levels available to users.
* Access management controls user permissions based on roles.

Payara Cloud's architecture relies on containerization and orchestration to deploy, manage and scale applications in the cloud.
It supports a variety of deployment scenarios and offers flexibility in configuring and customizing the runtime environment.
