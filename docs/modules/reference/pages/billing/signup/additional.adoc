=  Initiating an Additional Subscription

All users of Payara Cloud have the ability to initiate additional subscriptions, provided they have access to the necessary payment information.
Billing Managers can start a new subscription using existing payment data, while other users must input new payment information.

This feature enhances cost management transparency since each subscription has its own invoice and billing period.
This allows for separate invoicing for different projects or departments.

== How to Access the Subscription Dialog

To create a new subscription, click on the btn:[ Create New Subscription] ❷ button found on the left-hand side menu, under the expanded Subscriptions section ❶:

== Selecting Payment Details

The next step involves choosing how to proceed with the payment details:

* To start a new subscription with new payment details, click btn:[Create New Subscription with New Payment Details].
This will redirect you to the link:subscription.adoc[Signup page], where you’ll be prompted to enter new company details and authorize a new payment method.

* If you wish to use existing payment details, select btn:[Use These Details] next to the desired Payment Details.
Only the payment details of subscriptions where you are a Billing Manager will be listed.

== Signing Up with Existing Payment Details

Selecting a plan is the first step, similar to the regular signup process.
Note that usually, you are not eligible for a trial subscription for an additional plan, as Payara Cloud allows only one trial per user.

If these are not the correct details, clicking btn:[Use New Invoicing Payment Details] will prompt a confirmation dialog:

Selecting btn:[I wish to use new details] will initiate the signup process, as if you selected btn:[Create New Subscription with New Payment Details] in the <<_payment_detail_selection>> section.

However, if the listed payment details are correct, proceed to the final step by clicking btn:[Continue to Confirmation].

You also have the option to subscribe to Payara Cloud product updates via a newsletter.

Clicking btn:[Subscribe] will begin the provisioning process for your new subscription, which should complete in under a minute.
