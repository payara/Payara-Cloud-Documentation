= Registering and Logging In

Payara Cloud streamlines user authentication with three convenient options:

. Email and Password
. GitHub Account
. Google Account

== Email and Password

Upon visiting the Payara Cloud Billing Management console, you're greeted with a registration screen:

.Payara Cloud Signup Screen

This method differentiates between new signups and existing account logins.
If you're already a member, simply click on "Already have an account? btn:[Log in]" ❶ button.

Should you attempt to register an existing account, an error message will appear:

> Something went wrong, please try again later

=== Resetting Password

If you forgot your password it is possible to reset it by clicking btn:[Forgot password?] on the Log In screen:

.Log In Screen with option to reset password

Enter your username or email address on the subsequent screen:

After clicking btn:[Continue],  an email will be sent to the corresponding user:

.Password Reset Confirmation

The email looks like this:

.Password Reset Email

This email guides you to the password reset page:

NOTE: The legitimate password reset feature operates exclusively on the domain login.payara.cloud.
Confirm you are on that page before entering your new password.

== GitHub Account

Selecting the GitHub login method will redirect you to GitHub login page:

.GitHub Login Prompt

For first-time logins, GitHub will request authorization for Payara Cloud to access your account:

.GitHub Authorization Prompt

Opting for the Google login method similarly redirects you to the Google login page:
