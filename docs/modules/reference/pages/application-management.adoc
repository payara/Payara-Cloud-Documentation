An application in {productName} represents the core unit of deployment and execution for your Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) projects.
{productName} applications must be developed using the Web Profile of the Jakarta EE (formerly Java EE) standard.
You can upload any number of applications to your account and organize them according to your project needs using Namespaces.
endif::[]

== Namespaces

A namespace acts as a container to isolate and group related applications.
It's characterized by a unique project name and a stage that represents the current phase of your application's development (e.g., "dev," "test," or "production").
The project name also forms part of the URL for your deployed applications.

=== Namespaces offer several benefits

* *Organization*: They help you keep your {productName} account well-structured, especially when dealing with multiple applications or projects.
* *Isolation*: They ensure your applications remain separate from each other, even if they're deployed on the same {productName} cluster. This prevents conflicts between different applications.

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]

* *Unique Domain and Sub-paths*: Each namespace has its own distinct domain within your infrastructure. Within this namespace, your applications are deployed at specific sub-paths, making them easily accessible and manageable.

* *Custom Domains*: You can link custom domains to a namespace, making your applications more accessible, professional and user-friendly with personalized URLs.
* *Logical Grouping*: Namespaces allow you to group applications based on their purpose or stage of development. For example, you can have separate namespaces for development, testing, and production environments.

To create a namespace:

. Click on "Create New Namespace."
. Enter a unique project name and select the appropriate stage.
. Click "Create Namespace."

You'll then be directed to the namespace details screen, where you can start adding and managing your applications.

=== Custom Domains

Custom domains allow you to replace the default {productName} URL with a more recognizable and brand-friendly domain name.

To add a custom domain:


. Select the desired namespace.
. In the "Namespace Actions" dropdown, click "Custom Domain."
. Click "Add Custom Domain."
. Enter your preferred domain name and click "Set Custom Domain."
. Follow the provided instructions to configure the DNS records with your domain registrar.
. Return to {productName} and click "Check DNS."

Once the DNS changes propagate, your namespace will be linked to the custom domain, and all applications within that namespace will be accessible via sub-paths of the custom domain.

== Applications

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]

An application in {productName} is the atomic, individual deployable unit in a namespace.

Applications must be packaged in the appropriate format based on their type:

* *Jakarta EE/MicroProfile applications*: Must be packaged in the Jakarta EE (Java EE) https://jakarta.ee/learn/docs/jakartaee-tutorial/current/platform/packaging/packaging.html#_packaging_web_archives[Web Archive (WAR)] format
* *Spring Boot applications*: Must be packaged as executable JAR files

Uploading and Deploying Applications:

. *Choose Namespace*: Select the namespace where you want to deploy your application.
. *Upload Application*: Click "Upload Application" and select your WAR or JAR file. If no special configuration is needed, check "Deploy Immediately."
. *Application Name*: The application name serves as the DNS name for its container. It can be specified in the UI, derived from the artifactId in your pom.xml (if Maven-built), or taken from the uploaded file name.
. *Configuration (if needed)*: If your application requires configuration, you'll be directed to the application details screen after upload. Here, you can configure properties based on your application type:
* For Jakarta EE/MicroProfile: MicroProfile Config properties, context root, and database connections
* For Spring Boot: Application properties and profile-specific configurations
. *Deploy*: Once configured, deploy your application by going to the application details screen, clicking "Application Actions," and selecting "Deploy Changes."
. *Access*: After successful deployment, your application will be accessible via the provided Application URL (allow for DNS propagation time).

=== Application States and Revisions
An application in {productName} can be in different states at any point in time. The following are the various application states defined by {productName}.

* PENDING: Uploaded but not yet deployed.
* RUNNING: Successfully deployed and accessible via application URL.
* STOPPED: Manually stopped and not accessible.

=== Starting and Stopping Applications
You can start or stop your deployed applications whenever necessary.
The Application Actions menu provides convenient options to manage the application's state.
If an application is in the STOPPED state, you can start it using the "Start Application" button or the corresponding option in the Application Actions menu.
This action will transition the application back to the RUNNING state, making it accessible online.
Remember a STOPPED application is not accessible until it is STARTED and moves to the RUNNING state.

=== Revisions
Each application uploaded creates a new revision or version of the uploaded binary.
You can view, edit, or deploy different revisions, providing version control and rollback capabilities.

=== Scaling
{productName} allows you to scale your applications horizontally.
This means you can dynamically adjust the number of instances running your application to accommodate varying levels of demand.

ifeval::["{page-site-edition}" == "qube"]
